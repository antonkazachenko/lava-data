        "text": "Sullivan County Democrat\n  NEWS ARCHIVES Established 1891 Callicoon, New York  \nhome  |  archives\n\nCounty Manager Aims to Restructure County Government\n\nBy Dan Hust\nMONTICELLO — March 13, 2007 — Big changes are coming to county government.\nSullivan County Manager David Fanslau unveiled his plans to restructure departments and committees during the County Legislature’s Executive Committee meeting Thursday.\nAmong the recommendations are the creation of a brand new branch of county government: the Division of Community and Economic Development.\nFanslau’s choice for its commissionership is newly hired Agriculture, Marketing and Economic Development Director Susan Jaffe, and she and her staff would be responsible for the Department of Economic Development, the Dept. of Community Development and Grants, Youth Services, the Empire Zone Program (already under Jaffe’s purview), and the Center for Workforce Development, plus working with groups like the Partnership for Economic Development, the Chamber of Commerce and the Industrial Development Agency.\nThe Division of Planning and Community Development currently oversees these departments and agencies, but in the new plan, it would transfer those duties to the new division and rename itself the Division of Planning and Environmental Conservation.\nCurrent Commissioner Bill Pammer would remain and be responsible for the Dept. of Comprehensive Planning, Geographic Information Services Functions, Mobility Management, Environmental Conservation, the new Endangered Property Protection Program, Real Property Tax Services, and Agriculture Planning Districts, along with working with groups like Communities Against Regional Interconnect.\n“The nice part about this is planning takes on more traditional functions [instead of economic development],” remarked Pammer.\nOther major changes include the elimination of the Division of General Services, which would fall under the Dept. of Purchasing and Central Services instead, which itself would be under the administration of the Division of Personnel. Also under Personnel would be the County Clerk, the Board of Elections, the County Historian, Veterans’ Services and the Dept. of Consumer Affairs.\nAs a result of these changes, the legislative committees which oversee county departments would be restructured and renamed accordingly.\nFanslau also advocated for a Facilities Planning Committee to develop a long-term building plan, especially when it comes to judicial structures.\nThis all comes on the heels of a Fanslau-created resolution approved in the Executive Committee to require potential agenda items for every legislative committee be received no later than two weeks prior to the committee meeting itself.\nSuch requests would be reviewed by the Division of Management and Budget and the Department of Law before being added to agendas.\nAll this, said Fanslau, is a way “to refocus and streamline some of the priorities the Legislature has set in the past few years.”\nIt’s also evidence that Fanslau is now confident of his leadership and staff’s skills, especially considering the new hiring/firing policy, which takes those responsibilities out of the sole hands of administrators.\nCiting concerns by county employees that certain departments engendered a culture of fear and reprisal should they voice issues to higher-ups, Fanslau has proposed that he or his designee (most likely Personnel Commissioner Pamela Rourke) sign off on any position appointments made by the division commissioners and other administrators.\nThe only leaders who could make their own decisions on such appointments would be elected officials like the County Clerk, Sheriff and District Attorney, and the non-elected Commissioner of Jurors, County Attorney, Board of Elections Commissioners, Director of Veterans’ Services and County Auditor.\n“I think there should be a system of checks and balances in government,” Fanslau explained. “This sends the message that a singular department head will not be able to determine who gets promoted or demoted… There is not some single authority that has jurisdiction over their destination as a county employee.”\nHe also is advocating for another cultural change in office politics: the idea that county employees work for all of county government, not just their particular division.\n“Sullivan County can’t afford… to have these rigid ‘silos’ built up,” he remarked. “… Basically, we need to share services and share staff.”\nLegislators seemed in approval of Fanslau’s suggestions, with Leni Binder asking that they be passed by the Charter Review Commission as well (which will be done).\n“This is an area we wanted him to look at,” confirmed Legislative Chair Chris Cunningham. “He’s looking at comprehensive, long-reaching recommendations.”\nAnd Cunningham indicated Fanslau’s got the Legislature’s full support – a crucial aspect, since it will soon vote on whether or not to approve these changes.\n“Hiring David Fanslau was the best decision I’ve been involved in since I’ve been on this board,” Cunningham remarked of Fanslau’s addition to the ranks last year.\n“We were looking for someone who’s hands-on,” added Legislator Ron Hiatt. “He’s not a caretaker – he’s a director.”\n\ntop of page  |  home  |  archives",

Some of the temporary rivers are reported to be over half a meter deep.\n\n#moscow #москва #останкино #storm #гроза ⛈😱⛈\n\nФото опубликовано Evgeny Ivanov (@fobos_v_grunt)\n\nSome 30 flights have been postponed at three major Moscow air hubs due to the ravaging storm that engulfed the city. However, there have been no cancellations so far and the airports continue to operate as usual.\n\n“The airports’ operation was not seriously compromised,” a law enforcement source told RIA Novosti.\n\nWhile no casualties have been reported within the city, three people have been slightly injured in the storm in Moscow Region, a health care source told TASS. \n\n“The strong wind has knocked down trees and teared off roofs from several houses. As a result three people have received minor injuries and bruises,” he said.\n\nThe meteorologists believe the foul weather came to Russia from Belarus. While it is expected to leave Russia’s capital on Thursday morning, it will spread further to the north and northwest reaching the city of Nizhny Novgorod, about 400km east of Moscow in the morning.\n\nПоймали ⚡💪#гроза #молния\n\nВидео опубликовано Катя (@beskisloroda)",

        "text": "5 Reasons You Need to Start Eating Cottage Cheese\n\n\nCottage cheese is available in several varieties. You have your low fat cheese, your low sodium cheese, or your cottage cheese with some fruit. As such, cottage cheese is one of the more versatile products in your kitchen. You should be consuming it on a daily basis. Among all of the cheeses you can find, cottage is one of the healthiest.\n\nThe best part about cottage cheese is its versatility. You can add it to both sweet and savory recipes. In the last few years, cottage cheese has risen up in the popularity ranks. Thanks to nutritionists who recommend it as part of a healthy diet, cottage cheese is rising up.\n\nMany think cottage cheese is just a bunch of protein. But it comes with a lot more essential nutrients, making it a great option for athletes that want to lose weight and build muscle. That being said, let’s take a look at several reasons why you need to start consuming cottage cheese.\n\nWhat is cottage cheese?\n\nLet’s explain for those who do not know. Cottage cheese is soft, white, and creamy fresh cheese that does not undergo aging or ripening process to develop flavor. The result is cottage cheese has a mild flavor, one that is vastly different than aged cheeses.\n\nMade from curds of pasteurized cow’s milk, cottage cheese comes in variety of fat levels. You have regular, low-fat, and non-fat options. You can also find it in different curd sizes from small to large. And the biggest versatility factor is you can find it creamed, whipped, with reduced sodium, sodium-free, or lactose-free.\n\nNutritional breakdown\n\nThe best way to understand the healthy benefits of a product is to look at the nutrients. For cottage cheese, this is how the nutritional breakdown looks like.\n\nThis is what you get in one cup of low-fat cottage cheese:\n\n  • 163 calories\n  • 28g of protein\n  • 6.1g of carbs\n  • 2.3g of fat\n  • 29% of daily dose of selenium\n  • 24% of daily dose of vitamin B12\n  • 14% of daily dose of calcium\n  • 30% of daily dose of sodium\n  • 22% of daily dose of riboflavin\n  • 7% of daily dose of folate\n\nIn addition, you get small amounts of vitamins B1, B3, B6, A, and minerals like magnesium, zinc, iron, and potassium.\n\nWhy consume cottage cheese?\n\nReason No.1 – Lose Weight\n\nWe mentioned early that cottage cheese is part of many diet plans. The reason is simple, in one cup, you get small amount of calories, but high amount of beneficial nutrients. Weight loss diets are better when you get some cottage cheese in there.\n\nAccording to most studies, high-protein foods can help you lose weight, and then maintain a healthy weight. Cottage cheese also contains the protein called casein, which helps increase the feeling of fullness. Think of cottage cheese as a dairy product very similar to eggs.\n\nWhen combined with regular exercise plan, cottage cheese will help you feel full, refreshed, and lose weight while eating and not starving.\n\nReason No.2 – Gain muscles\n\nIn addition to losing weight, cottage cheese helps you gain some muscles. It all depends on what is your exercise goal. Some want to lose weight, others want to gain muscles. Because cottage cheese is very high in protein, it can help you achieve both goals.\n\nWe all know protein is the main building block of your muscles, and you need it before and after exercise. The good thing about cottage cheese is you consume both before and after. It will give you enough energy to last through the workout, but also provide some refreshing factor after.\n\nIt all goes back to casein, a slowly absorbed protein. Casein is just as effective as whey protein, the one you find in most supplements. Casein can also help with absorption of the amino acid leucine, which improves the building capacity of your muscles.\n\nReason No.3 – Prevent insulin resistance\n\nAs mentioned, cottage cheese contains decent amount of calcium. Thanks to it, you can prevent and reduce insulin resistance. For those of you that do not know, insulin resistance often leads to development of type-2 diabetes, or the one that is considered fatal and deadly disease.\n\nReason No.4 – Selenium and more selenium\n\nSelenium is one of those minerals that is just hard to get. Not many products contain high doses of selenium, but cottage cheese gives you almost one-third of your daily dose. Selenium increases the antioxidant protection in your blood. By doing that, selenium reduces the risk for heart disease.\n\nReason No.5 – Improve Bone strength\n\nCottage cheese contains almost all of the crucial minerals for bone strength. Those are calcium, magnesium, selenium, phosphorus, and then some protein. All of these nutrients are linked with improved bone health.\n\nHow to add cottage cheese to your diet\n\nWe mentioned that cottage cheese is great for both savory and sweet dishes. You can also use it as a substitute for many other not-so-healthy ingredients. That being said, here are some easy ways to add more cottage cheese to your diet.\n\n  • Mix it as a substitute for milk in pancakes and waffles recipes\n  • If you want extra protein in your salad, add some cottage cheese\n  • You can mix it with fruits for a great salad. Some fruits that go well with cottage cheese include berries, mandarin wedges, banana slices, peach slices, melon chunks, and mango chunks\n  • Cottage cheese is one of the best sour cream and heavy cream substitute\n  • If you want a smoothie with extra protein, mix cottage cheese, milk, and some fruits\n  • You can use it as a spread on your toast for a creamy and protein-rich spread. Or you can use it as a mayo substitute in any sandwich\n  • For a creamier texture of your scrambled eggs, add some cottage cheese\n  • You can also use it as a substitute for ricotta cheese in lasagna recipes\n  • Last, but not least, all baked goods like muffins, cakes, breads, dinner rolls, and similar benefit from some cottage cheese\n\nAre there any problems with consuming cottage cheese?\n\nThe only downside of cottage cheese is it usually contains lactose. Because it is a fresh and unripened cheese, cottage contains more lactose than aged cheeses like cheddar or Swiss. Therefore, if you are intolerant to lactose, you should stay away from cottage cheese. Otherwise, you might experience problems like bloating, gas, stomach pain, and diarrhea.\n\nIn addition to lactose, cottage cheese contains allergens like whey and casein, which are also problematic for some people.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLike it?

        "text": "Skip to main content\n\nOur first walk of the year by River Song\n\nToday the most interesting thing happened.  After we got out of bed our harnesses were put on, our leashes were attached to them, our Daddy took the handle of the leash in his hand, and me, Pocket, Mommy and Daddy went outside and Mommy told us we were going on a “walk.”\n\nI vaguely remember a walk from four months ago.  I was pretty sure it happened outside, there were great smells, wonderful people, and I could poop and pee freely.  But it had been months earlier, before winter came with the hundreds of Pockets of snow, the nasty wind, and slippery ice, so I couldn’t be sure.\n\nWe started and slowly it all came back to me.  The smell of the ground was amazing.  So many messages from friends who had trekked out before us.   Pocket and I made sure we left lots of messages explaining our absence and saying we were back.   I swear you can communicate more with one pee than a thousand words.\n\nAnd I remembered the daily struggle, me pulling as hard as my little legs could pull, and Daddy holding both leashes in his hand keeping us next to him as the pressure cut circulation to his fingers.\n\nThe grass didn’t tickle my paws, it lay there mushy and lifeless, but with my super-sensitive hearing I listened to it growing under the ground, getting ready to stand up, turn green, and reach for the sun.  And deeper down I could smell the flowers preparing to beautifully pop up.\n\nI was so caught up in everything I forgot to poo.  But I won’t forget tomorrow.\n\nSummers coming and the time is right for walking in the street.  \n\nFor more terrier adventures click here here\n\n\n  1. Walkies time again! That's wonderful!\n\n  2. Yea for walkie time. Have a wonderful Wednesday.\n    Best wishes Molly\n\n  3. yep we actually have got to go twice in one week....there is hope yet isn't there!!\n    stella rose\n\n  4. It's raining today but at least it'll help the flowers to grow.\n\n  5. YES! there is hope that spring is here!\n    Mr Bailey, Hazel & Mabel\n\n\nPost a Comment\n\nPopular posts from this blog\n\nMonday Question\n\n\nWordless Wednesday\n\nRiver Song 2012-2022\n",

To me the concept of light and dark is a primary example of our relationship with God/Light/Spirit. After wanting to put their knowledge of “good and evil” above their relationship with God, they built a barrier, even if only a leaf, between themselves and also between them and God. When the Spirit asks “Where are you?” it is a recognition that humans can choose to try and “hide” from the Light. However, darkness (sin?) cannot put out light; it is only a barrier that shuts out the light creating the darkness.\n\n    These barriers are “rebuilt” each generation as we are “taught” to hide from each other and build barriers between ourselves. Because of these barriers the Light is not evident in many of our deeds and thoughts. As we break barriers between each other (Love thy neighbor) we break the barriers to the Light (Love the Lord).\n\n    Thus the kingdom of God is made up of those that are little children who have not yet built the barriers.\n\n  • Thank you, Tom. You speak my mind.\n\n    I’ve also considered that the Garden story mentions a second tree.\n\n    My take on this is that Adam and Eve “discover” the ability to name things as “right” and “wrong,” yet they are still finite, fallible, and mortal. We tend to forget that last piece.\n\n    YHWH says, in effect, “Let’s not let them also eat from the tree of eternal life while they are still under the illusion that they have omniscient knowledge of what is good and what is evil.”\n\n    In other words, they were put out of the Garden to protect them from that further disaster…until YHWH could figure out how to fix things.\n\n    Blessèd Be,\n\n  • Pingback: In between « The Empty Path ()\n\n  • Pingback: Living in between « The Empty Path ()\n\n  • Pingback: The Empty Day, again | The Empty Path ()\n\nComments are closed.\n\nSite Footer",

        "text": "Monday, December 03, 2012\n\n\nDidn't plan on taking a break from blogging over the weekend, but circumstances made that happen. A brief recap:\nCathedral of St. Paul\n  • Benster's Boy Scout troop had a field trip on Saturday to complete requirements for the Citizenship in the Nation merit badge, so we were bopping around St. Paul, taking in three important landmarks in the city -- the Cathedral, the State Capitol and Mickey's Dining Car. I hadn't been to the Cathedral since Mrs. D and I attended the ordination of a family friend more than 16 years ago. It is a magnificent building and it was a good reminder to the scouts of the ambition of the people who built this area. The Capitol restoration project is going well and the Minnesota Historical Society does a very nice tour, including a fairly long explanation of the art and history contained in the governor's reception area, a room that is familiar to anyone who watches a news conference on television. The architecture at the Capitol is also magnificent, which is unsurprising since Cass Gilbert was the principal architect who worked on the facility. And for a bunch of Boy Scouts who ranged in age from 12-17, the trip to Mickey's was probably the biggest highlight of all. It's a good thing that you can still find places like Mickey's around, but there aren't that many any more. It's a classic greasy spoon with excellent short-order cooking in enormous portions, all in a retrofitted dining car. If you haven't gone, you should. I think the scouts learned more about America at Mickey's than they did at any other stop on the field trip.\n  • It was a good weekend for football if you are a Wisconsin sports fan. The Badgers took out a season's worth of frustrations out on Nebraska, absolutely destroying the proud Cornhuskers 70-31. I've seen the Badgers drop 70 on weak sisters like Austin Peay, Indiana and Northwestern before, but never on a team with the talent and pedigree of the Cornhuskers. It's been a very difficult year for the Badgers -- losing three games in overtime tells you that they were close to having a much better record than the 8-5 mark they currently sport. You could argue that the Badgers have no business going to Pasadena for a third consecutive year, especially since they were only a .500 team in conference play. Yet if you watched them play on Saturday night, you saw a very good college football team with quite a stable of running backs. Barring injury, I would expect to see Montee Ball, James White and spectacular freshman Melvin Gordon all playing in the NFL some day.\n  • Speaking of spectacular running backs, the Vikings certainly have one in Adrian Peterson. Peterson is having an astonishingly good year, coming back stronger than before following what looked to be a career-threatening ACL injury late last year. The show that Peterson put on in Lambeau Field yesterday was something to see. And yet, and yet. . . the final score was Green Bay 23, Minnesota 14. The Packers are a battered team with more serious injuries than just about any team I've seen, yet they still managed to win the game. It's a credit to the Packers that they were able to gut it out on Sunday, but I think the Vikings have be concerned about their quarterbacking. I'm no expert, but it looked like Christian Ponder was not an NFL-ready quarterback yesterday. The interception he threw early in the third quarter completely changed the game and gave the Packers a chance to come back. The backup quarterback is always one of the most popular people in town and there are a lot of calls for putting Joe Webb in the game, but I'm pretty sure that if he were the answer, he'd be playing. He isn't. A more competent NFL quarterback would have finished off my beloved Packers yesterday. Fortunately for the Pack, the opponents didn't have one.\n  • From what I can tell, politics are exactly in the same place we left them. So we'll leave that topic alone.\n  • Oh, and yesterday was my birthday. It was very nice and I had an enjoyable day with my family, including a trip to yet another greasy spoon (the 5-8 Club) for dinner. I probably need to have a salad for the rest of the week.\n\n\nW.B.

        "text": "Concealed Carry & Home Defense\n\n15 Good Things About Three Models of Guns\n\nBarbara Baird\n  • See All Articles\n  • Send Email\n  • Subscribe to RSS\n  • Bio\n\n      Barbara Baird\n\n      Publisher/Editor Barbara Baird is a freelance writer in travel and outdoor markets, She is the publisher of and a blogger at A certified NRA handgun instructor and RSO, she can be found most weekends at the range or afield.\n\nBy Barbara Baird, Women’s Outdoor News\n\nIf you’re looking for a handgun for personal protection, you’ve got your work cut out for you. A recent search of the exhibits at the National Rifle Association’s Annual Meeting in St. Louis gave me the opportunity to talk to the company representatives about the guns and also, to handle them. If only … there were an accompanying range nearby, so that I could shoot them. Because only when you shoot a gun can you tell if it truly is for you. Just like when you try on shoes. You must walk in them first.\n\nTammy Ballew and Britney Starr also checked out the guns and as you can tell, we had a good time together.\n\nLet’s get started. These are some of the reasons I like these guns.\n\nShe likes! Tammy Ballew likes the look and feel of the new Shield. Photo by Barbara Baird\n\nThe buzz at the show centered around Smith & Wesson’s Shield, available in 9 mm and .40 cal options. Here are five things I like about this gun: 1) a skinny Minnie at only .98 inch at its widest, 2) comes with two, single stack magazines (the second one is a little longer and can hold one more, plus it extends the stock a bit so you can get a three-fingered grip), 3) patented Palmswell grips (think of filling in all the parts of your hand), 4) stainless-steel chassis (think sweat and summer) and 5) it looks like its counterparts in the M&P line. MSRP: $449.\n\nSafari outfitter Britney Starr, of Starr and Bodill, thought the Mustang was a little thoroughbred. Photo by Barbara Baird\n\nColt’s little pony, introduced earlier this year and believe me, it created a buzz at SHOT Show, the .380 Mustang Pocketlite, continues to find its way into pocket holsters and purses across the land. I shot it last January and frankly, was shocked at its accuracy. Five things I like about the Mustang: 1) short, single-action trigger, 2) sleek, shiny, scaled-down beautiful 1911 look, 3) lightweight in an aluminum-alloy lower receiver, 4) major components were cast, so that means tight tolerances and 5) commander style hammer. Colt also makes nice 9s, like the Defender. MSRP: Under $600.\n\nThe ladies, Tammy Ballew and Britney Starr, really thought the P238s felt \"balanced.\" Photo by Barbara Baird\n\nWe couldn’t leave Sig out of the loop, so we stopped there, too. A rep told us that the P238 continues to be a favorite little carry gun with the ladies. Five reasons why? 1) It weighs under a pound 2) anodized alloy beavertail style frame with wood grips that are so secure and so … beautiful, 3) stainless steel slide with slide serrations (I am a stainless snob), 4) sweet sights (SIGLITE rear Night Sight and Tru-Glo Tritium Fiber Optic Front Sight and 5) perfect trigger. I shot this one recently. I like it. MSRP: Somewhere in the middle of $500. Also, note all the configurations and attractive colors of this gun at the website.\n\nSo many guns. So little opportunity to really try them. Unless you live in a big city with a big indoor gun range with a big variety of rental guns, you often have to 1) take your chances and hope that the guns shoots to your liking, 2) beg or borrow a gun, 3) keep putting it off until someday, 4) shoot thousands of bullets through several that don’t fit (How many shoes have you taken to the charity shops?) and 5) go to that big city and rent that gun for downrange time.\n\nDo you have a little favorite you’d like to tell us about … and maybe even five reasons why?\n\nThanks to Barbara Baird of Women’s Outdoor News for this article.

        "text": "Wedding Photography Focused On Real Moments & Emotions\n\nHi! I’m Matt, a London wedding photographer loving life in the cultural melting pot that is this wonderful city. I capture the unforgettable moments shared by you and your favourite people. Parent’s proud tears, belly laughs at your best friend’s speech, and kids napping under tables while grandma busts out crazy moves on the dance floor. Are you looking for all those in-between moments that are just as valuable as the big ones? Then maybe I’m the perfect wedding photographer for you.\n\nWedding Photographer Based in London, UK\n\n“Wow! Simply wonderful, we cannot help browsing through these photos over and over again :) Matt capture facial expressions and special moments so well, we cannot recommend him enough!”\n\nYanika & Luke\n\nWhy book Matt as your Wedding Photographer?\n\nCharacter & Emotion Filled Photos\n\nThis is my jam! My photography is focused on capturing the amazing characters of your favourite people and their relationships with you. I love to capture all the emotions from the subtle to the outrageous, from smiles, to tears, to wows. Why? I believe this is the best way to enjoy the awesomeness of your wedding again and again for years to come. As well as keeping your memories fresh, my photos will allow you to enjoy so much of the day that you missed the first time around.\n\n\nHaving photographed over 140 weddings across 18 different countries and 3 continents, I can adapt to anything your wedding throws my way. From challenging locations and lighting, to tight time lines and vocal family members. In the lead up to your wedding we’ll be communicating to ensure you get the best out of your wedding photography experience on the day. If you book me you can be confident that your wedding photos are in safe hands.\n\nA Calm & Happy Presence\n\nIn addition to providing you with hundreds of amazing photos of your celebrations I also want to be a positive addition to your wedding day and your memories of it. While I mostly blend into the background, I won’t claim to be invisible. In me you’ll always find a smiling face and a calm and reassuring presence. The experience you and your family and friends have with me on your wedding day is just as important as the photos themselves.\n\n“Matt captured the personal interactions between and the emotions of the day so vividly. Have since recommended him to my sister in law for her wedding”\n\nSian & Ed\n\nFeel uncomfortable in front of the camera?\n\nThe majority of my couples mention this in their opening email to me, so you are certainly not alone. My natural and relaxed approach is perfect for people like you.\n\nAt your wedding I will mix in as one of the guests so that you can forget the camera is even there. This approach also allows me to capture all the action as it happens up close without being intrusive. Even during the portraits and formals (the only time you’ll ever see me direct anything) things are kept fun and relaxed. So if you usually feel uncomfortable in front of the camera, you have nothing to worry about. I’ll also interact with you ahead of your wedding so I’m not rocking up as a stranger on the day.\n\nI’ve been booked by dozens of couples who weren’t going to book a wedding photographer over fears of the impact of their presence on their wedding day. They then saw me photographing a friend’s wedding and realised that it was possible to get amazing photos without feeling the presence of a wedding photographer.\n\nLearn More About My Approach\n\n“Everyone commented numerous times how unlike other photographer Matt was, not in anyway intrusive but instead he just blended in like one of the guests (at times I almost forgot he wasn’t a guest).”\n\nBonita & Ian\n\nLove is Love\n\nI’ve been incredibly lucky to work with so many inspiring couples across different cultures, classes, religions, races and sexual orientations. These experiences have highlighted one simple truth – love is love.\n\nI pride myself on delivering the same high quality experience to all my couples, equally. The diversity I’ve witnessed through this job is one of the reasons I love it so much!\n\n“When looking back over the photos one feels as if the music has just been turned down low and we are straight back in there! We cannot recommend Matt enough!”\n\nEliza & Brom\n\nCapturing Memories All Around The World\n\nIt’s been a real joy to capture so many incredible wedding celebrations around the World. It brings together my passion for photographing weddings with travel and exploring new places. From Denmark to Mexico and Ethiopia to Nepal, I’ve been extremely lucky to have so many amazing couples put their faith in me. And I always offset my carbon.\n\nIf you’re currently planning a destination wedding and believe my photography would be a great fit, I’d absolutely love to hear from you!\n\nDestination Wedding Photos & Packages\nNot Planning Your Wedding Adventure Yet?\nProud To Be Featured On\nmore logos of wedding online publications\nlogos of wedding online publications\n\nThink I’d be the perfect fit to photograph your wedding celebrations? I’d love to hear from you!\n\nPicking a wedding photographer can be tricky right?! There’s so many styles and approaches out there! That’s why I offer a video call where you can meet me, see a full wedding gallery and ask me any questions you might have. Allowing you to confirm I’m the perfect fit for you.\n\nSay Hello",

        "text": "Mailing List\n\nThursday, June 29, 2017\n\nWalkawayWalkaway by Cory Doctorow\nMy rating: 5 of 5 stars\n\n\nI admit I went in blind to this only know the title, the cover, and the fact that I've been a big fan of Cory Doctorow ever since Little Brother. I thought it was going to be something of a thriller with perhaps a political and especially an awesome technological bent to it.\n\nI didn't expect it to be this huge! The ideas in this novel can easily be ranked up with the very biggest novels of the last century.\n\nLet me explain: Walkaway as a term is nothing more than dropping out of the ranks of the norm, of going off to live simply, if not precisely without tech, then at least giving up on the whole rat race that is defined here as the \"default\". It's not hippies, although there are those, too. It's a collection of all the people that this world has no use for, the people that despair under debts they can't pay, lives that bring them no joy, of people who realize that they have always been slaves in everything but name.\n\nThese are the people who walked away from it all. It's in the future so we have an honest free beer with open source technologies, 3d printers much more advanced than what we have here that works with everything from clothing to medicines, and the open idealism that collides with regular assholes that you'll find in any human population.\n\nOnly, these communities are benefited with social modeling techniques, even newer tech that can scan and model human minds, and much more... in everyone's hands. These are people who gave up on wealth and status to live in all kinds of communes and social experiments, many of which fail but each improves upon the last until better and better open source societies are created, improved upon, and tested... and while this shouldn't have been a big deal to the rest of the world that was busy doing its old thing, the Walkaways stumbled upon success and success, outperforming and making the \"Default\" society jealous... and you know what jealous people do when they have guns and they want what the defenseless have.\n\nI'm just barely scratching the surface here. There's a lot of great characters, a lot of really beautiful stories and situations and social experiments and theory on human consciousness. There's a lot of tragedy and hope, too, spread out over a great long span of time. A lifetime, you might say. But by the end, who's to say how long that is?\n\nThis is really creative and hard-hitting exploratory SF. This is the stuff that will stay in my consciousness long, long after hundreds of lighter SF have rolled through me. This is that kind of novel that can change or break a whole society if it takes off.\n\nNow, I can't say that I absolutely agree with all the points that Doctorow makes, but his vision of the future and the erudition and thoughtful expression of all these fantastic ideas more than makes up for any complaints I may have. He's a believer in humanity. He believes in people.\n\nThere's something truly wonderful about that.\n\n\nView all my reviews\n\nNo comments:\n\nPost a Comment",

        "text": "Home / Seriously Funny: A Defense of the Comic Strip in an Age of Diminishing Returns\n\n\n\nIn a perfect world – OK, my perfect world – the funny papers would be taken more seriously. Publishers would allot comic strips more space, color and flexibility, and artists would be encouraged to innovate and to broach sensitive subjects.\n\n\nIt’s a risky move involving difficult choices – especially regarding the fate of old friends. Readers – many of whom have formed personal relationships with beloved comic strip characters – will become boisterous. And yet, we must soldier on! A new golden age for newspaper comic strip art is possible!\n\nFirst, let us dispense with the unpleasantries: Goodbye, Blondie. Goodbye, Hägar the Horrible. Goodbye to you both – Hi and Lois. You will be respectfully interred in a comic strip mausoleum (or relegated to the classifieds – which is almost the same thing). In your place: Strips that are bolder, more fluid and dynamic, more relevant to the 21st century and its newspaper readership.\n\nBut why bother? In an age of declining newspaper revenue, it may be hard for people who don’t read comic strips – or who dismiss their significance – to sympathize with my idealism. A newspaper isn’t a magazine, so why turn it into one? And print media is dying across the board. Why waste additional resources on a bunch of talking animals, reruns, tired classics, et al.?\n\nWhy? Because comic strips and the artists who create them are funny, engaging and bold in a way that other sections of the newspaper are not permitted to be. They are little island universes where anything goes – perfect vehicles for satire. Plus, they can serve as contact points for social commentary on the lives shared daily by millions of readers.\n\nIf the newspaper industry is to be transformed from without by market forces, then I say let it also be transformed from within by human motivation and action.\n\nStart with the most fundamentally restrictive aspect of comic strip art – the panel – and move forward from there. Artists rightly grumble about their work being squeezed into near-illegibility. But there’s at least one example of an artist who was able to buck this trend.\n\nBill Watterson fired the opening salvo in a war which cartoonists have been losing ever since. In 1991, Watterson demanded – and was given – more flexibility for the Sunday version of his acclaimed strip “Calvin and Hobbes.” Thereafter, until the final strip in 1995, Watterson continuously experimented with the Sunday format, stretching the panels like Silly Putty (sometimes removing them completely), and providing space for his characters to roam and romp across the page.\n\nBy demolishing the existing boundaries of comic strip art, Watterson was simultaneously harking back to an earlier era and providing a model for the future of the medium. Imagine if modern exemplars of the craft – Rose Is Rose, Mutts, Bizarro, Non Sequitur – were permitted to push the envelope daily, bursting the genre’s boundaries, to the reader’s surprise and astonishment! Might such a set-up entice readers to subscribe to the print version of a daily newspaper?\n\nThat’s how it used to work. At the turn of the last century, comic strips were used to help sell newspapers. They were colorful and had their own sections; often a single strip would be given its own page. In 1945, during a newspaper strike, New York City Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia read the comics aloud on the radio.\n\nUltimately, the fact that cartoonists need newspapers in order to make a living is a compelling enough reason to keep them in the daily newspaper.\n\n“We receive literally pennies from online publication and readership,” writes cartoonist John Forgetta. “Newspapers wonder why they can’t attract new, younger readers? Perhaps it’s because they refuse to let go of old comic strips.”\n\nImage credit: Wikipedia\n\nPowered by\n\nAbout Matt Geörg Moore",

This one is really hard to explain. One round of integration by parts doesn't cut it. Only after two rounds of integration by parts can you get an answer. Just do two rounds of integration byparts. Then you will see that your integral in your SECOND time of ibp is the SAME integral as the one you started with times some constant. With this, you can add or subtract it back to the left hand side and then divide out.\n\nNot the answer you are looking for?\n\nSearch for more explanations.\n\nAsk your own question\n\nOther answers:\n\ni got so far as to thinking it was going to be one of those integrals that has the repeated original equation within the integration by parts but there is a -1/6 in front of it and i don't know how to get rid of it without it getting messy\ndid i maybe do it wrong? or is there supposed to be a -1/6 in front of the repeated original equation?\nYou're right. Like I said before, you probably have some constant multiplied with it. It's the very same integral right? So what do you do if you have a = b + c + d + a/2 and you need to solve for a? I'd subtract a/2 from both sides: a/2 = b + c + d and get a = 2(b+c+d) Here, your integral is a!\noh geez i feel dumb = (\nNo worries. In college classes, people don't see it either! Actually, most don't even get to your point in solving the equation haha.\nthat's how it is for me most of the time lol\n\nNot the answer you are looking for?\n\nSearch for more explanations.\n\nAsk your own question",

        "text": "Archive for the ‘Wisconsin’ Category\n\nScott Walker Walks Into His Own Trap (Limerick)\n\nTuesday, February 11th, 2014\n\nUPDATE: The blogger who interviewed Governor Walker and whose Walker quote is the premise of this entire post and limerick, has corrected his story to indicate that the quote was a transcription error and that the Governor did not claim to have voted for Reagan when it was illegal to do so.\n\nRather than simply “disappearing” this post, I’ll leave it up with this correction notice. My apologies to anyone who was misled by my reliance on the earlier version of that interviewer’s story.\n\n\nRepublicans have a long history of bolstering their credentials by citing some Ronald Reagan connection. So it tends to be no big deal when a Republican pol waxes eloquent about having voted for Reagan.\n\nAnd then there’s Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker (R), who recently said:\n\nI remember, I was a teenager, had just become a teenager and voted for Ronald Reagan — limited government, you know, smaller government, lower taxes, strong national defense. You knew what you were getting. You knew how a Reagan administration, a Reagan presidency was going to be better for you.\n\nAlas, since Walker was born on November 2, 1967, he “wasn’t old enough to vote in either 1980 or 1984 when Reagan ran for president.” So if Scott Walker was being truthful, then he’s just owned up to committing voter fraud.\n\nScott Walker Walks Into His Own Trap (Limerick)\nBy Madeleine Begun Kane\n\nWalker tried to increase his appeal\nWith a “voted for Ron Reagan” spiel.\nDo the math; Scott’s denoting\nHis under-age voting.\nFin’ly, ONE case of vote fraud that’s real.\n\nLimerick Ode To Tommy Thompson\n\nSaturday, November 3rd, 2012\n\nStay classy, Tommy Thompson:\n\n\nLimerick Ode To Tommy Thompson\nBy Madeleine Begun Kane\n\nIn the cringe-worthy GOP crop\nThompson’s coarseness continues to pop.\nHe defends with a smirk\nHis lobbying work:\nNeeded money — “my wife likes to shop.”\n\nLimerick Ode To Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker\n\nThursday, March 3rd, 2011\n\nI wrote this when the story of the Scott Walker / David Koch prank phone call first broke. But then I somehow forgot to post it. So a belated bravo to Ian Murphy of the Buffalo Beast for playing that entertaining and enlightening stunt on Scott “Union Buster” Walker. And now, at last, my limerick:\n\nLimerick Ode To Wisconsin Governor Walker\nBy Madeleine Begun Kane\n\nGov. Walker has fallen afoul\nOf a prank that made Democrats howl.\nHe lengthily spoke\nTo a pseudo Dave Koch,\nSpouting schemes that make honest folk scowl.",

        "text": "What makes me tick…..Blogging 101\n\nHiya fellow bloggers:\n\nThis is my first assignment on the online course Blogging 101.  It is wonderful to be on a public forum such as The Commons, sharing what we’ve all come together for, mainly to learn and expand our knowledge of blogging.\n\nMy name is Loretta, I started Safariofthemind about 8 months ago.  At the time I had just returned from a trip to Brazil and thought I’d start writing about my adventures there, add some gorgeous photos, and thus my journey began.  My blog mainly focuses on cooking these days, but I also blog on gardening and travel.  It has been quite a stimulating ride thus far.  In the past, I’ve written short reports and journals on some of my travel adventures, but always kept them to myself, or perhaps circulated it among family members.  Since then, I’ve felt a need to go public, meet like-minded folks and expand my horizons in this field.  I have learned so much in these past 8 months, I feel more confident, my photography skills have improved and I am meeting folks from around the world.  One tends to forge special relationships via this medium, and I’ve really come to appreciate that immensely.  My greatest thrill on WordPress is watching my blog grow, analyzing my Stats each week, and feeling remarkably intrigued when I see the world map showing the countries that are reaching my blog.\n\nI’m hoping to learn more from this course, I’d like to improve the general look of my blog, meet some of you and discuss ways where we can help each other along the way.  Please feel free to comment, whether positive or negative on how I can improve.  Much obliged!\n\n30 Replies to “What makes me tick…..Blogging 101”\n\n  1. When I first started blogging, I was terrified of commenting on others posts 😀 I think you have been amazing with your posts as well as your encouraging comments Loretta! Looking at the world map in Stats is my favorite part too!\n\n    Liked by 2 people\n\n    1. Aww, thank you Naina, that’s awful sweet of you to say. I thought by joining Blogging 101, I could improve my own blog and learn from others. Your posts are always so vibrant and colorful, love your photography and your recipes too. I don’t just pay compliments for the heck of it, so consider that genuine :)).\n\n      Liked by 1 person\n\n    1. Aww, you’re so sweet Julie, thanks! It’s mind-boggling and overwhelming to see literally 100’s of folks from around the world taking part. I’m sure I’ll come away with a wealth of information. 🙂\n\n      Liked by 1 person\n\n      1. Are you still in contact with these friends? I am trying to invite a few to FF, I mean that’s the only way folks can get traffic on their blogs. I had no idea what linky parties meant in the beginning 🙂\n\n        Liked by 1 person\n\n  2. What a joy meeting you, Loretta. Love your post and your photos are awesome! It’s good to connect. Thanks for reaching out to me. Cheers for an awesome class time and friendship beyond! 🙂\n\n\n      1. Hey Loretta…sorry in delay of reply…I just learned how to find comments and respond back. Hehehehe. To follow me, I think you just need to click on my name, it should take you to my site, and then click follow up at the top of your WordPress border. At least, that’s how I do it on mine. 🙂\n\n\n      2. No, it wasn’t your fault, I think WP had those up, in The Commons, but like I said, I couldn’t find any for you, so I’m not sure what went amiss there.\n\n\n  3. Hi Loretta…Moving your Blogging 101 badge is simple. Just go to your dashboard and choose “customize” then “widgets” then choose the position where you placed your text box for your badge, you can click and drag to any location on your page. Hope this helps.\n\n\n    Liked by 1 person\n\n    1. Aww, thanks so much Countryhearbeat :)… and your real name is???? So far I think I’ve really learned a lot in 2 short days and stumbled on so many wonderful folks. How about you?\n\n\n      1. My real name is Jess 🙂 I was surprised that I gained like 5 followers in one day (for a blog that only had a few to begin with after months and months, that was a huge deal for me!!) I haven’t “learned” much per-say, I’m fairly familiar with the blogging stuff… but it is giving me the motivation and focus that I need and “assignments” to complete. Towards the end of last year I had kind of gone astray and I really want to focus on building my audience this year! I even pass out business cards with my blog address on them! I’m hoping this course introduces me to cool new blogs to follow as well as introduces ME to people who may be interested in my stories! 🙂 Good luck to you!!!\n\n\n      2. OK, so here’s your 6th follower Jess :)). I had no idea what a tagline was or even where to find it, today I gave my blog a tagline and I’m quite chuffed!! :). You need to find some linky parties, that’s how you attract folks to your blog. I had never heard of them prior to blogging. I wonder how you could find country music linky parties though 🙂\n\n        Liked by 1 person\n\n  4. Loretta, you are a joy! Only eight months? I feel I know you for longer than that. We all started blogging with all kinds of thoughts, and progressed to something else… and then, with better understanding and courage of how it all works, we go back to implement what originally we had in mind.\n\n    Liked by 1 person\n\n    1. Oh you’re lovely Fae, thanks so much. I too feel we’ve known each other for a very long time – perhaps it tells how warm and receptive you are to new bloggers :). Yes, I’m pretty up to my eyeballs with this course, but it has taught me a lot already. I do enjoy getting to know folks from near and far via this platform, and that definitely includes YOU! 🙂\n\n      Liked by 1 person\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts and comments.\n\n\nWordPress.com Logo\n\n\nGoogle+ photo\n\n\nTwitter picture\n\n\nFacebook photo\n\n\nConnecting to %s\n\n%d bloggers like this:",

        "text": "Monday, July 30, 2007\n\nWP installation and configuration: This can be painful.\n\nFirst of all there’s very little detail in the installation manual on how to actually configure Webpublisher to work correctly. For example, here’s how you first set up a template:\n\n1. To import your first Template file, first you have to know what an example template file should be, then you have to know that to import you must create a new “category” whatever that’s supposed to be, go into that new category and then import. Patched together functionality or what?\n2. To edit your first Template, you need a rules file. So you go to the “Rules” area and create one. You go back to the Template, check it in (because it was checked out when you to edit it the first time), View/Associations and click on Rules, and Add the new Rule. Is this intuitive enough yet?\n\nSecond, once you’ve installed the WP, you have to install and configure Site Cache Services (SCS). Configuring the website publishing using Documentum Administrator is relatively straight forward, however, when it comes to figuring out what happens during a SCS publish, you’re kind of on your own. One thing to check is the SCS configuration in WP. To do this, click on “Web Cabinets”, select the cabinet that you are publishing, and click on “View” and select “Web Cabinet Overview”. This should show you the publishing configurations that were configured earlier using DA. Here’s what happens during a Site Cache run:\n1. Either the SCS job executes or WP promotes a doc to Staging or Active which invokes the dm_webcache_publish method.\n2. SCS service reconciles modified files with the configuration and the source SCS tracking table.\n3. A properties.xml file is generated and sent over to the target SCS server.\n4. Content is transferred via http or https to the target server.\n5. On the target, when all of the files have arrived, target SCS processes database inserts and deletes if there’s a database, it expands zip_html files, it copies the files from the temp directory into the live website, and much more.\n\nFile extensions: htm vs. html\nThe first time you site cache the html renditions you’ll notice that the files are published with the “htm” extension. To get the files to publish with an “html” extension, you’ll have to make changes to the webcache.ini file located on the content server in the “/Documentum/dba/config” folder.\n\n\nYou’ll also have to change the extension of the html format using Documentum Administrator. It took me a day of part-time rummaging through the forums to piece together this configuration fix.\n\nThere will be times when you want to throw up your hands and give into a beginner WP class, but by investigating this issues that arise first by browsing the forums at EDN and Bluefish and other site, you’ll learn as you go and more importantly remember what you did when you need to configure WP again.\n\nWednesday, July 25, 2007\n\nWebPublisher Business Requirements: Who Are We Writing These For?\n\nIf someone tells you that Business Requirements are not that important to your role as a developer, ask them what happens if you need to make a change to them? Get involved in this phase if you can because BRs set the tone for the whole project, and you need to meet and get to know all the team players. Most developers get pigeon-holed into roles that suggest that they just do what you tell them to do; follow the specs… It might feel comfortable to do this, but you’ll always feel frustrated during the process, especially if you need to push back on the BRs.\n\nKnow Webpublisher\nAs you sit through the Discovery phase (if you get invited) you’ll gather incite into the issues that really matter for the project and who will be looking for what functionality. What happens during the business requirements writing phase is that everyone becomes an “expert” in Webpublisher. The requirements reflect what the business thinks WP can do OOB, not necessarily what it’s potential is. To be fair, the main objective is to use WP OOB as much as possible, but also to find the middle ground in terms of configuration vs. customization.\n\nConsultants Who Know Everything\nIf there are outside consultants, especially those newly graduated from our fine Ivy League schools, they will commandeer the discussions about requirements and do breakout sessions to fine tune their own understanding of the requirements and their skills in Excel. Business school graduates are fond of Excel and can achieve incredible feats in expanding BRs to new levels of complexity. These are well thought out, but are usually overkill for OOB WP functionality. Make sure the consultants know WP functionality inside and out before they start writing BRs. The more the requirements grow in size and complexity the less likely that the business users will read all the requirements and sign off on a document they can completely grasp.\n\nThink about the whole application\nIt’s easy to get bogged down by concentrating too much on the details. For example, there were many times when we drilled down on the requirements only to realize that it was close enough to OOB functionality that we didn’t need to write it all up. By “whole application” I mean:\n- What’s the end to end flow of content through the system?\n- Who will access the content and when?\n- What level of support can be sustained?\n- How much training will be needed?\n- Do you have enough resources to satisfy all the requirements?\n\nWhiteboard the end to end flow\nOne absolutely necessary step in the requirements process is to draw out the end to end flow of content so that everyone is on the same page. This flow diagram will serve as a milestone of the group’s understanding of the application. It will be altered and republished, but the core flow should not change. This flow should have a combination of technical and visual elements. It should be of use for the business side as well as the IT side. Everyone needs a visual representation of the application and now is the time to create it.\n\nThere will be times when an issue can not be resolved by the people within the team. This is the time when you spin off pros and cons of the possible solutions to the problem. This is also the most frustrating time of the project, when egos are flying and a lot of time is wasted. A few types of issues I’m talking about are:\n- Configuration vs. customization\n- Integration vs. manual data entry\n\nConfiguration vs. Customization\nIt’s easy to get excited about developing new functionality to WP mainly because WP has many foibles that are usually corrected during the first release of the project. However, you have to weigh customizations with wanting a smooth upgrade path. One of the WP projects I was a part of was so heavily customized that management waited until the version was no longer supported and then had to plan the upgrade to which was scheduled to talk over a year to accomplish. This type of customizing indulgence is usually avoidable if the right balance of Configuration and Customization is achieved.\n\nThe typical pros and cons of these issues involve:\n- Cost\n- Length of time to develop\n- Testing\n- Functional worth\n- Priority\n- Impact on upgrading\n\nThere are all sorts of integrations that you can do with Documentum, the one I’d like to talk about is one with Documentum Compliance Manager (I’ll carry this example throughout this series on WP). The pharmaceutical company I worked for wanted to be able to run certain regulated web content to DCM. A content flow diagram was created and a prototype was developed during the requirement writing phase mainly because no one knew for sure if integrating WP with DCM was even possible. By architecting the solution with a TBO we were able to integrate with DCM without disrupting any of DCM’s functionality.\n\n“Nice to have” vs. an absolute must\nWhen you have the business users in the room they will say everything they bring up is necessary. But, when pressed, they’ll start to admit that some functionality is “nice to have”. WP offers many features that can be configured to get close to most requirements around publishing to a website. I’ve migrated from a custom Documentum web application to WP and the biggest complaint was the amount of versioning that goes on in WP. They also had very complex ideas on how to organize the content. These ideas carried over into WP as categories. WP categories are versatile and powerful when used in the right way, but, in our case, we went way overboard. We had over 10k nodes, multiplied by 10 locales. This was and continues to be a nightmare.\n\nTwo thorns of WP publishing\nThere are two issues that plaque WP: Security and Navigation. Customizations gravitate toward these two monsters. Why hasn’t EMC purchased or built a web server / app server yet? Sitecache is nice, it’s decoupled, it scales. However what happens when the content gets to the website? The coupling of the decoupled security and navigation is a sink hole for bad performance and enormous support issues.\n\nMonday, July 23, 2007\n\nDiscovery: do they really know what they want?\n\nAs a Developer, depending on the size of your company and how enlightened the management, you’ll most likely get involved with the Discovery phase of the project. If you can try to influence who’s on the Discovery team by suggesting other resources which you trust will “do the right thing” try to do it before the first meeting.\n\nDon’t solve the issues: listen\nThe first few meetings during this phase are spent listening to the Project Manager(s) go over what they believe are the questions that should be asked and the corresponding answers from the Business Manager(s). Developers: don’t try to solve these complaints in the meeting, just listen and answer questions when asked. Be careful not to ask detailed questions at this point, as the discussion will dive way too deep into the nitty gritty and could get religious. The managers need to hear themselves talk. If you create too many disruptions at this point, they’ll write you off as a pain.\n\nKnow OOB functionality cold\nI’ve been in situations where I knew the functionality being asked for what hard to implement, but wasn’t 100% sure and couldn’t back up my gut feeling with proof. If I had known WebPublisher OOB functionality better I would have been more effective in arguing my point. One way I dealt with not knowing the answer to a technical question was to suggest that I prototype the functionality and get back to the team with an answer the next day. This allowed me to get proof (or not) of my gut feeling and work through possible solutions without getting shutdown immediately. This also saves lots of time and effort in the long run by exploring the ramifications of a small decision which could balloon out the project (80x20 rule).\n\nWhere does the content come from?\nThe content of the website project was already designed and developed, but was being hosted on a tradition web hosting site. The website content was FTP’d to the site and manually published. The users wanted “everything we have now” and more. The “everything we have now” was a black hole which needed to be dealt with asap. What can you do with a statement like that without going through a huge process of requirements gathering? What we came up with was punch list of what WP does and presented it to the business.\n\nLumpers and Splitters\nOn the project team, there will be people who like to drill down on every piece of functionality, not only to understand it but to drive others crazy. They like to split issues into smaller pieces and understand them better that way. Others like to lump issues together and hand off the large understanding to those who understand the software (WP) better. During each meeting the lumpers and splitters will go at it. If you can catch this happening before it gets too heated, call for another meeting to hash out the particulars. It’s important to keep the focus on manageable chunks of the project.\n\nWho’s poking holes in the boat?\nDuring these meetings, at first it was hard to figure out who was aligning with whom in terms of making the hard decisions about what functionality was in and what was out. Over the course of a few meetings, it became clear and it also was obvious who was fully invested in the project and who didn’t care. The folks who didn’t care reacted by saying things like:\n- “Let’s cross that bridge when we get there”\n- “We don’t have any expertise in that area”\n- “We don’t have the time or money to do things the right way”\n- “Let’s get a consultant in to look at this, I know someone…”\n- “What are the risks involved with this decision?”\n\nSense of Urgency\nRemember that managers like to drive the project to their own schedules. During the discovery phase, if you don’t push back when necessary, you’ll be setting the stage for long hours down the project lifecycle line. Managers want to push the project along no matter what issues arise. Let’s say you’re trying to decide whether to use WP’s import screen the way it is or to customize it. This kind of exercise requires time and attention to detail. If something is missed, you’ll pay for it later.\n\nYour homework\nAs the high-level, prioritized issues are ironed out you’ll get a better picture of the scope of what’s being asked for. During the priority step, you should fill in a matrix that you make up on your own. Columns that I’ve used in the past are Requirement, Priority, Scope, Effort, Custom/Config, Cost:\n\n- Requirement: This is the specific functional piece of functionality that is being asked for by the business.\n- Priority: The weight given to the requirement by the business.\n- Scope: All the WebPublisher, technical and project-related ingredients of the requirement.\n- Effort: Gut feeling on how much time it will take to accomplish.\n- Custom/Config: Are there any customizations? Is it really all configuration? Try to find any holes that are not being discussed\n- Cost: Any potential sink holes that will be expensive.\n\nRequirement: Automate website approval process\nPriority: 1\nScope: Design workflow template, notification design, prototype, user testing, rework, application migration from dev, to test, to integrated test, to training, then to production.\nEffort: Moderate\nCustom/Config: Mostly configuration, possible customization: deal with aborted workflows.\nCost: Developer training, consultants\n\nCognitive Dissonance\nTake note of Business folks and members of your team who do not admit when they are wrong or have made a mistake. These are the people who will sometimes unwittingly take the project of course and will need to be reigned-in when they do so. They are also the people who pull some of the team aside and have “off the record” discussions about the project. They occasionally need ego boost by show boating an experience in the past that they think is important: “the way I did that at was to implement with .\n\nThe following are some paths of discovery decisions and where it took WP customizations:\n\n- Implemented RSA Cleartrust\n- Had to add 2 servers per environment: 10 in total\n- Had to hire an RSA consultant for initial installations\n- Spent numerous cycles with basic documentation and endless trial and error troubleshooting.\n- Customized the login, denied, and logout pages\n- Held up the project as authentication became the critical path during the initial testing phase\n\nMultiple Locales\n- Used Categories to manage multiple languages for the website navigation.\n- Created 10 sitecache configurations, times 5 for each environment.\n- Redesigned the web cabinet structure to accommodate the new content submission groups.\n- Trained publishers how to add translations and publish them.\n- Created a custom application to integrate with outside translation vendors.\n- Dumped huge amounts of money on developing an automated way to process the sitecache target content and metadata.\n\nAutomated Navigation\n- Designed a simple way to publish navigation changes based on folders and linked content.\n- Developed a TBO and customized WP to prototype the functionality.\n- After the User Demo, we rewrote the design and developed a much more complex solution.\n- This went on for a few more cycles until we had to stop and move on to other aspects of the project to meet our schedule.\n- The business said they wouldn’t make any changes to the site folders for a year. After the site went live using WP, within a month they were changing the navigation.\n\nDiscovery is a term used for exploring what the business would like to have. What it really means is finding out what is realistic to have now and what is going to be released at a later date. There will always be disappointed members of the team who will never be satisfied and other who will feel over worked. Hopefully you’ll have a balance of these types with the more motivated types who enjoy what they do.\n\nFriday, July 20, 2007\n\nDocumentum In the Trenches: WP\n\nI have been working with EMC Documentum's Webpublisher long enough to know a few things about the got yas during the phases of a website project.\n\n  1. There is no guide that provides a soup to nuts view into how a website publishing project is designed, developed, and implemented.\n  2. Webpublisher will have issues, it's just a reality.\n  3. As with most websites the business requirements will focus mainly on the look and feel of the site, not the mechanics of how you get the content on the site.\n  4. If you like to follow project schedules closely then you better pad in time because you're going to need it.\n\nWith these four observations in mind, I'd like to take you on a ride down Webpublisher memory lane with a project that I recently completed (no projects are ever really done, who's kidding who?). The structure of my remembrances will following the usual project lifecycles:\n\n  1. Discovery: do they really know what they want?\n  2. Business requirements: who are we writing the requirements for?\n  3. WP installation and configuration: This can be painful.\n  4. Prototyping and proof of concept: This is fun!\n  5. Specs: We'll write these if we have to.\n  6. WP Development: Try not to Thrash.\n  7. Deployment: That wasn't in the spec!\n  8. Training: That was easy; until they actually start to use it.\n  9. Stabilization: Is anyone using this?\n  10. Support: Who's doing it?",

        "text": "Category Archives: Spartan Race\n\nHellmecula Race Day\n\nWell, the day has finally come. I am about to start the hot Temecula Spartan Race Beast. Hope I spent all that time preparing correctly for this one. Hope I have enough fuel and water. I also hope they don’t cut the race short… \n\nTahoe Inbound!\n\nI went and did it… I signed up and paid for my death warrant. The Tahoe Beast is ready for me, I just have to drive there. I only have a week after Temecula(Hellmecula) to get acclimated to the cold and altitude. I think I’m a little screwed ha. Well, I have all day to finish, so I should be fine. The next day Sunday for a charity race, as well? Maybe. It’s for charity, after all! Plus, it counts as a Sprint for the next Trifecta, so that helps wipe my tears away.\n\nI’m In Trouble…\n\nI’ve been heat training for months to prepare myself for Temecula. It might be stupid hot next weekend. And then I found this posted all over Facebook from various people, in multiple groups.\n\n2015-09-17 21_40_23-Squaw Valley Alpine Meadows\n\nThis isn’t Temecula, Tahoe for the Spartan Race World Championships the weekend after. Norm, himself, guaranteed This Tahoe World Championship to be the hardest Beast ever designed. All the big names in the industry will likely be there. Which is why this is a race I shouldn’t miss. But that early snow really is freaking me out right now.\n\nWhat to do, what to do…\n\nThen again it might be a fake picture or the snow already melted because if you check the livecams, they’re all brown dirt. I still have to wait until after Temecula to decide.\n\nSpartan’s Hardest Obstacles\n\n…at least according to a survey.\n\nIt’s an interesting article, but from my point of view this is fairly wrong. But that’s probably because I have a strong upper body.\n\nIf I could reorder the list above it would probably look something like this:\n\nSpear Throw\nHercules Hoist\nBucket Carry\nAtlas Carry\nRope Climb\n8ft Wall\nClif Multi Rig\nMonkey Bars\nBarbed Wire\n\nSure, rope climb is up there, but only cause there’s easier ones I’m not worried about at all.\n\nHawaii Spartan Race Reflection\n\nI’ve had a little time to think and reflect about the Hawaii Spartan Race Trifecta Weekend. I had a great time; I mean, it was in freaking Hawaii. Of all the times I’ve been to Hawaii, it’s the first time I did an event like a Spartan Race, or any race for that matter. I’d like to do one of the XTERRA races eventually.\n\nHowever… because it is a “licensed” race, Spartan Race Hawaii isn’t given the luxuries regular mainland races so, such as the ability to give away free races to volunteers. This was the kicker, and even made me not want to volunteer. That would explain the lack of volunteers on race days and the unorganized fashion everything was laid out. My wife brings up the point that if you don’t have volunteers you should dig into the profits and get more paid positions to help the event. With poor organization (long lines at late reg, broken obstacles) and sheer mayhem (the headbands on day one, or none at all!) are people going to come back next year? Previous racers might balk at the chance and new racers might hear about it, think twice, and spend their money on a mainland event. I could be very wrong and everyone will sign up anyway. I just might.\n\nOverall, even if it isn’t Spartan Race it still could hurt their brand. I would hate it if Spartan Race Hawaii loses their license; Kualoa Ranch is a beautiful venue, one of the best I’ve been to for any type race.\n\nWhere was I going with this? While not a perfect event, it was still a Spartan Race in one of the most beautiful settings. I finished the race, got my medals/t-shirts, and had fun doing it. Were there problems, yes (long lines for late reg, missing/disorganized headbands, lack of abundance of post race recovery fuel), but all of this could be overlooked as minor issues in favor of the bigger picture. As soon as it’s available I just might sign up for the full trifecta weekend!\n\nI still would have liked my souvenir headband though… Does anyone have a 7183 headband?\n\n\nI look so freaking tired and thankful it’s finally over, LOL.\n\n20134ad576f186c2914b67dd63ac7391 a4250c6a9390c48490d827a78fa3703a b885b0c5c7cf05360d75f9ffb862dd4b\n\nHawaii Trifecta Weekend Part 2\n\nI probably shouldn’t call these two posts “Hawaii Trifecta Weekend.” It WAS the Hawaii Trifecta Weekend, but I didn’t run the trifecta and the titles might misrepresent my involvement in the actual said trifecta.\n\nLet me semi-start this post with, I DID NOT RUN THE TRIFECTA IN HAWAII. Better? Okay, let me continue. Today, I ran the Sprint with my wife, my brother, and his GF. We finished in about an hour and thirty minutes and it was roughly 4 miles, according to my Garmin watch. Not bad. I’m proud of my wife who tried really hard with little training, and actually little failures in obstacles. Sure, I did a lot of the work, which basically doubled my load. Sure, I did most of her burpees. But she finished, and I’m truly proud of her. If you ever get to meet her, she’s a little dainty flower, you wouldn’t think she would do one of these. I’m sure maybe a year or so ago he would flip her shit if you tried to get her to jump in the mud. But she did it, and even without a single “eeew” or the like.\n\nAnyway, let her get her own blog, LOL. Today was the Sprint. Yesterday was the Beast. Sadly, no Hawaii Super for me this year and my pretty medals won’t ever match with their blue counterpart. Yes, OCD senses tingling. I’ll live. Just makes me want to pre-reg for next year. Or, will I? The organization was such a mess. If you haven’t read yesterday’s post, please do. Today, I don’t think all the headbands were all over the grass. However, ALL of our headbands (two different sets of numbers) were not delivered to Spartan Race Hawaii and we had no headbands. There was a banana cut in half for each person, and a coconut water drink at the end; That’s it. They needed to get more or better sponsors here. All of the other Spartan Races have a ton of freebies at the end, Clif Bars (This might just be California Spartan Races since Clif is based in Berkeley, CA), protein drinks, whatever. Where’s the swag? WHERE’S THE FREE BEER?! That’s right, I said no free beer. Maybe I should have started with that one… I’m sure many Spartans alike will be more pissed off about missing the free beer than anything else. It could be a venue issue. Just like how there are no fire jumps at the Monterey Toro Park Spartan Races.\n\nAll of these problems are very minor because at the end of the day I did my race, I had fun, I got my finisher t-shirt and finisher medal. (There are reports that people did not receive finisher stuff!) Sure, all the little things add up. But do I lifetime ban it just because of these problems? I don’t think so. It’s still Spartan Race, licensed or actual. I’ll likely sign up for the trifecta weekend next year.\n\n2015-08-16 21.53.55\n\nMy haul from the weekend.\n\nHawaii Trifecta Weekend\n\nSo, I’m here in Hawaii (not to do the whole trifecta, mind you.) and I signed up myself, my wife, my brother, and his GF to do the Open Sprint on Sunday. And for some STRANGE reason I get an inkling to rent a car and do the Beast the day before, so I do it. So, THIS JUST HAPPENED.\n\n2015-08-15 14.46.20\n\nMean mugging the camera. I’m old, ok? I don’t know how to do this selfie thing all the young kids are doing…\n\nI don’t know how, but I pushed through every mile of the Hawaii Spartan Race Beast. Which I might add, was poorly run. Sure, I was a late reg. Many people were, MANY. But only one person was working the line, poor lady. I do feel sorry for her, she was preggo and had to deal with a BUNCH of pissed off Spartans. I missed my hopeful start time of 7am by TWO hours. Not only that, but in order to get headbands I had to wade through a bunch of piles of headbands on the ground. There was a loose order to which they were laid out, but so many Spartans also flipping through them, they were everywhere some 7000s here, 5600s there, etc. It was bad. This contributed about 30 minutes to my 2 hour late start. It was so bad, I started with the Super heat start time. I had to cut in line to the front to catch up with the Beasts. To top all this off, I could probably shave of at LEAST an hour of my time because of an issue the park had with a rope descent which broke and we were all standing at a steep & muddy incline for what felt like forever. So many more pissed of Spartans. Just another obstacle to deal with today…\n\nDespite all this, it was a good day for me. I finished trifecta number one. But because it was impromptu, I didn’t have my other two medals, and couldn’t post pictures with all three medals. So, I’ll probably do that in Temecula or Tahoe. Whelp, time to go to sleep and do this all over again. Well, shorter distance, but in the mud again…\n\n2015-08-15 05.53.26\n\nBright fking early.\n\n2015-08-15 12.45.28\n\nCows, not obstacles.\n\n2015-08-15 14.56.22\n\nRandom cliffs of Kualoa Ranch\n\nAT&T Park Spartan Race Sprint\n\nLast weekend I had the opportunity to earn another piece of my Spartan Race Trifecta. I ran with a couple guys from high school and a friend from work. We somehow ditched my coworker from the small confined spaces of the bleachers, but more on that later…\n\nThis Spartan Race was the Sprint, a 3+ mile obstacle course race. Located in San Francisco at the AT&T Park where the Giants play, there wasn’t a lot of room for a race. But, they managed to squeeze it out of the place. Utilizing every nook and step of AT&T Park the race was pretty difficult for a short Sprint. I think I touched almost a third of all the steps in the bleachers in the entire stadium. Or at least that’s how it felt…\n\nThe race went through a bunch of the stadium, some never seen by your average baseball/concert goer, change/locker rooms, VIP Box seats, etc. However, it felt really claustrophobic. Up, down, through all the stairs and seats, with only two rows available at a time, there wasn’t a lot of space to pass up slow people, which is where we lost my coworker. Slow people cutting off other people, not abiding by the stay right rule… He got caught behind a bunch of slow people and never caught up with us until the very end. At least he had a good time. We all had a good time. And now I have TWO pieces of my trifecta. Too bad my beast isn’t for another two months! I can’t wait!

This is my first Spartan, second OCR, and 5th overall officially timed race. Of the three difficulties of the Spartan Race (Sprint 3+, Super 8+, and Beast 10+), this was the middle “Super”), but I’ve watched plenty of videos and talked to people so I knew what to expect…\n\nContinue reading",

        "text": "Tuesday, October 26, 2010\n\n\nWell we finally know what was causing the fevers. Roseola. It was my thought since she had a high fever an no other symptoms. Well this morning she woke up covered in the tell tale rash. I have never been so thankful to see a rash in my life. Little E is still not back to her super happy self but she is certainly on the mend. I stayed home with her today and she took a super long morning and afternoon nap. Pretty much she slept all morning, ate lunch and went back down for a nap. She was up for a total of an hour between the naps. She slept horribly on Sat, Sun and Mon night so I have a feeling she is playing a bit of catch up. Shazam is home with her tomorrow so Thursday we should be ready to go to daycare. Fingers crossed. While she is feeling better she looks a little rough around the edges right now with a rash all over her face, chest and back. I am so glad that we had to reschedule our family photo shoot to next week. Splotchy rash is not what we are looking for on the holiday card.\n\nOn a final note we have a new badge on the left. On November 17th we will be blogging for Preemies. I want to encourage all our readers to take the time to blog for babies on November 17th as well. Whether you have a preemie or not on November 17th take the time to remember the thousands of babies born too soon every year.\n\n\nwishinghopingpraying said...\n\nI am so glad it wasn't anything more serious! Roseola sucks though, that fever is so scary. I hope E is feeling like her self again.\n\nSivan said...\n\nThose unexplained fevers! Your doc was right to rule out a UTI or Kidney infection. Once that was confirmed I figured you'd be seeing a rash one of these days. Glad she's through the worst of it.\n\nHope to see you on Friday evening if you're up for it.\n\n\nthiswillbe said...\n\nSounds awful. I hope Little E is well on the mend by now. Thanks for the note about November 17. I will try to remember myself and will look here for your post as well.",

The phenomenon of early Christmas merchandising, known as “Christmas Creep,” is overshadowing Halloween this year, the newspaper reported. \n\nJuly 17, 2011\n\nAn article in the Tampa Tribune reported that a Tampa builder who agreed to move families out of homes built with toxic Chinese drywall and make the necessary repairs has now rescinded the offer.  \n\n© 2013 Home Channel News.

In today’s post, we are going to be revealing to you some business opportunities that can earn you at least A million Naira before 2018 runs out.\n\nIf you are ready, read on.\n\n1 Onion Products:\n\nAccording to fact fish, Nigeria is the eight largest producers of onion in the world and produces about 4.3% of the onion produced globally. This translates into billions of naira for those that know how to utilize the opportunities that lies in onion.\n\nI will show you 2 very important onion opportunities that can earn you a million naira in 2018.\n\nFirst I will start with onion seeds: I know not a lot of people knows about what onion seeds are, these are very tiny seeds that are planted to get onion. They are much smaller than tomatoes seeds.\n\nOnion seeds are mostly available for purchase between the months of august and September in the northern part of the country.\n\nThe unfortunate part of it is that most of the farmers that will need those onion seeds for dry season farming of onion are still battling with their farms and in most cases are church rat broke because of the expenses on their farms.\n\nSo, around this period (august – September), if you buy and store this onion seed for about a period of 2 months, the price can double up to 5 folds or more. I mean an investment of N250k in these seeds can yield over 1 million naira in profit.\n\nSecondly, under onion products I will also discuss about onion itself\n\nOnion stored during the months of august and September also doubles about 8 folds during December. Onions are abundantly available during august – September, so they are very inexpensive.\n\nIf you took a typical case study in 2017, onion that was selling for between N2800 to N3500 per bag during august in most northern states that produces onion when up to N28, 000 upwards in most other parts of the country in December 2017. This means that, a 250k investment will translate to over one million Naira in profit.\n\n2. Sweet Potato Chips Production:\n\nThis business requires very little startup capital. The major raw material which is sweet potato is very inexpensive. What you require to get started are: wide frying pan, oil, iron drainer, vinegar and other spices, slicer and packaging. The package can be a white leather that have a seal and a little paper inserted for contact details and bulk buyers.\n\nLet’s do some basic analysis. Cost of production per pack is N15, selling cost to hawkers and other resell outlets is N35. Profit per pack is N20. Let's say you have 20 hawkers that sells 20 packs each daily and 20 supply stores that sells an average of 10 daily. This will translate to 20 packs x 20 hackers = 400 x 20 profit = N8000 naira profit daily from the hawkers.\n\nFrom the supply stores: 20 stores x 10 packs each = 200 x N20 profit = N4000 profit daily from the supply stores.\nN8000 + N4000 = N12, 000 daily profit x 30 = N360,000 monthly. If you multiply by the remaining 10 months in 2018 we have N3.6 million naira.\n\n3. Local Drink Production\n\nThese drinks can be any of the local drinks that are In high demand. They can range from “kunun aya, Ginger Zobo, Soy Milk” etc. you can also start in a very little way, you can borrow coolers, pots, big bowls etc and then buy your own gradually.\n\nIf you master the production this drinks, the profit per bottle depending on the form of packaging can range between N30- N70.\n\nIf your profit per bottle is N30 make your goal targeting 5 distribution outlets that can sell up to 30 bottles of the drink daily. This will amount to 150 bottles daily.\n\n\nPost a Comment",

        "text": "Controlling the IrrigationCaddy from the Internet\n\nControlling the IrrigationCaddy from the Internet, either from your smartphone device, or from any computing device with a standard web browser is simple.\n\nThe best known method to do this, is by using “Port Forwarding“. Port Forwarding is the ability to map an external port on your router, to an internal IP address + port combination.\n\nExternal IP Address\n\nMost residential users have a DSL/Cable Router. I own a WRT610N router made by Linksys. I will use my router’s interface to guide you through, however you will have to adapt the instructions to your own router’s interface. The router is your gateway to the internet. All traffic coming into or going out of your network has to go through your router. Now the router has an IP address assigned to it by your ISP (Internet Service Provider).  \n\nRouter's external IP address\n\nRouter's external IP address\n\nSo that is your external IP address. This is the address you have to use when you are on the Internet in order to access your network. By default your router will reject pretty much anything trying to get into your network using this IP address. So let’s say your External IP is:\n\nif you go to your browser and type:\n\nyou will probably get an error message, and nothing will display. However what you would like to do is to type something like:\n\nand in return get the IrrigationCaddy user interface. The 8095 number after the colon is the port number.\n\nInternal IP Address\n\nWhen you install the IrrigationCaddy on your network, the IrrigationCaddy will have its own IP address, which is “internal” to your network. This IP Address is only valid within your own home network, and you cannot reach it from the Internet; unless you use Port Forwarding that is.\n\nInternal IP Address\n\nInternal IP Address\n\nYou will notice that above the Internal IP Address, on the Settings page, the “HTTP Listen Port” is also listed. This is the port number that the IrrigationCaddy is listening on for HTTP connections. So when you are sitting at your computer, and type the following on your web browser:\n\nthe IrrigationCaddy’s user interface shows up. Since 80 is a standard port number, you don’t have to explicitly write it on the address, but I am listing it here for illustration purposes.\n\nPort Forwarding\n\nNow the fun begins.\n\nThe idea is to map the external IP address, and some port of your choosing on the Router, to the Internal IP address and the port number that the caddy is listening on. So that when you are away from home, and just got notified that your city just applied watering restrictions, and you would like to change your watering schedule, you can do it from your phone, simply and quickly. This is done by configuring your router to do Port Forwarding.\n\nPretty much every modern DSL/Cable router supports this feature. They all have different user interfaces, but the concepts are the same, and you should be able to adapt the methods explained here, to your own router.\n\nOn my router, the Port Forwarding feature is under the “Applications & Gaming” tab.\n\n\nPort Forwarding\nPort Forwarding\n\nIn  the picture shown above, you can see that the settings required to setup port forwarding are pretty self explanatory. There is an “External Port”, an “Internal Port”, a “Protocol” (TCP or UDP. You need at least TCP ), and the “To IP Address” ( this is your internal IP Address ).\n\nIn the example shown we are telling the router that when someone tries to access our router using the “external” IP address,  and it is going to port number 8093, that the call should be routed to the internal IP address “″ on port 80. Now it just happens that that IP address is the IrrigationCaddy’s IP address, and that 80 is also the port number where the IrrigationCaddy is listening for connections.\n\nThe result is that when you open your web browser and while on the internet you type:\n\nthe IrrigationCaddy will respond to this call, and answer by sending back the IrrigationCaddy’s user interface HTML code. If the call was made from a web browser somewhere on the internet, the browser will display the familiar IrrigationCaddy web page.\n\n\nNOTE: Make sure that when you setup Port Forwarding, you also enable “Authentication” on the IrrigationCaddy. When Port Forwarding is enabled, anyone on the Internet, which knows your External IP address, is now able to do what you can do on the browser. So you want to make sure that if someone is able to access the IrrigationCaddy through the internet, that they are not able to login and change your settings. You don’t want people you don’t know playing with your water bill; so be careful.",

        "text": "November 12, 2012 in Gardening, Journal\n\nI have often seen bloggers pontificating about nobody being entitled to judge others. A lovely ideal, but we do it all the time whether conscious of it or not. The trick is not to do it hastily or nastily.\n\nAnyway, it is judging of another kind which has been one of the many things keeping me away from blogging recently. The Garden Judges Association subsection of the Durban and Coast Horticultural Society does all the organising of the Garden of the Year Competition, and especially for committee members (of which I am one) and Chair (Sr-i-L, who ropes in more senior judge Much Better Half) it is a really busy time. We inspected and judged some particularly stunning gardens this year, and I must show some pictures of them from time to time. For this post, I have selected only some of S-i-L’s pics of the actual Garden of the Year.\n\nAt the prize-giving on Saturday, we were fortunate to have the appropriately-named Nancy Gardiner to hand out the prizes. Her photojournalism has graced virtually every gardening magazine in South Africa for many decades, and through magazines and her books she has become well known in most gardening countries of the world, No less than four plants have been named after her. She is an active and vivacious 91-year-old, and related with amusement the horror with which some of the residents of a complex she has moved into recently, younger by far than herself, greeted the sight of her digging a large planting hole. Also her disgust at being offered a wheelchair for a recent flight she undertook!\n\nIsn’t that orchid simply too spectacular to be real? Really, it is really real, though.\n\nWe also had a brief presentation on the history of DCHS since formation in 1903. The Exotica shows put it on the world stage of gardening, and it is a pity times have changed to the extent that trying to revive them would be risky in the extreme. Some really big names have been involved in it over the years – and it was Evah Sew Posh. Hopefully we have made it a bit less of a Haughty Cultural Society these days!\n\n© November 2012 Colonialist (WordPress/blogs24)\n\n2 responses to JUDGE NOT? PIFFLE …\n\n  1. ‘The trick is not to do it hastily or nastily’ – this is so very wise. Because as you say, judging is inevitible. But it is not the judging that is the problem, but the manner and the spirit in which we judge.\n\n    Oh, I am not a gardener but those are wonderfull puctures. Thank you.\n\nAdd Comment Register\n\nLeave a reply\n\n\n",

That's why I also got a big pile of interesting film experiences that merit their own list here. Since each and every one of them has been dealt with in this blog before, I'll keep their reviews short and sweet, and put a link to their name for details.\n\nBubbling Under: Another Earth, The Death of Pinochet, Our Day Will Come\n\n10. Red Forest Hotel \nDirector: Mika Koskinen\n\nAn eye-opening look at the damage western companies are allowed to do in countries such as China, where people are unequal yet there is still a lot of natural resources to harvest. At first it seems that this documentary isn't going anywhere with the government officials constantly following the director. But when in the end it gets to the truth it is harrowing. A true achievement.\n\n9. The Mountain (Fjellet)\nDirector: Ole Giæver \n\nA raw, emotional look at a couple trying to rekindle their flame by going on a hiking trip. Problem is, past tragedies come to haunt them, and thus the bitter bickering starts. The mountainside nature of Norway is unforgiving, people must find inner peace within themselves alone.\n\n8. Cold Fish\nDirector: Sion Sono\n\nA tough, uncompromizing, yet darkly comedic vision of the crumbling of the traditional japanese nuclear families. With a push-around as the head of the family, they all are forced to the edge of their lives, and getting exploited. The villain, one of the most memorable in a long time, is a truly twisted criminal. He is able to get away with murder and even fucking with the yakuza, because he relies on timid people not to fight against him. The film's a bit too long, but when it's great, it's great.\n\n7. Bullhead (Rundskop)\nDirector: Michael R. Roskam\n\nAnother tough crime film with an unique vision of an individual's place in the spiral of violence and madness. The Belgian countryside would've been one of the last places where I would've imagined such a story to take place in, yet the fields are just steaming with blackness. Roskam is one to watch in the future, too, as well as Matthias Schonenarts as the lead.\n\n6. Public Speaking\nDirector: Martin Scorsese\n\nIn Fran Lebowitz, Scorsese has found such a rewarding documentary subject, that he himself has trouble to keep up with her. Like the auteur's classic works, this also picks an interesting character from New York and follows her around the city. Lebowitz is a straight-spoken woman, whose opinions may offend many, but she is also hilarious, and a good speaker, so it's no effort to hear what she has to say about the modern way and life in general.\n\n5. Play\nDirector: Ruben Östlund\n\nThe Swedish Funny Games, without all the navel-gazing and vague threats instead of physical violence. This takes a distant, documentary-like, look at bullying and problems that arise from multiculturality in sleepy Swedish suburbs. The problems are not caused by the immigrants themselves, but rather the Swedish-born adults, generally turning a blind eye to the acts of children. When something bad happens, they take it out on innocents. The film leaves the viewer with a lot to ponder about.\n\n4. Cave of Forgotten Dreams\nDirector: Werner Herzog\n\nHerzog has found good use for the 3D technology, and allows us common people to see one of the most incredible pieces of art in the world as it was meant to: the 20,000-year-old cave paintings of the Chauvet caves of Southern France with all of their surfaces, curves and shapes. The viewer would be content by just watching the beautiful pictures, but Herzog also finds his trademark madcap interviewees and has his own philosophical ponderings about the subject. Very captivating and a strong film.\n\n3. Finisterrae\nDirector: Sergio Caballero\n\nA weird little film that I'm sure will divide opinions. But it's tongue-in-cheek humour, metaphysical ponderings and sense of oddness won me over. The film has a sort of pilgrimage for ghosts, who wish to become alive again. The religious symbols and kitchy Halloween-imagery will clash. The film is like a Jodorowsky film made on a budget of about 50 cents.\n\n2. Tyrannosaur\nDirector: Paddy Considine\n\nPaddy Considine proves to be one of those actors that has paid close attention when working with auteur directors. His debut film is so dark and violent at parts that even strong-stomached viewers are forced to flinch. Yet it has a glimmer of hope in that even bad people can redeem themselves, and make the world around them a better place. Considine's film defies expectations. At first it seems like a vigilante picture waiting to happen, but it actually has more liberal viewpoints. A film about trust, love and friendship, that features a dog getting kicked to death.\n\n1. The Kid With A Bike (Le gamin au vélo)\nDirectors: Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne\n\nThe Dardenne brothers are some of the most interesting filmmakers today, and they have produced their most accessible film to date. That's not to mean that it's without substance, au contraire. The film features the young Cyril being tempted by a juvenile criminal on one side and a surrogate mother on the other. The kid has learned to fight for himself so how can one teach morality to him, when even his father has abandoned him? The film's characters have three-dimensional motifs, and more than a hint of tragedy in them. The film's plot moves steadily forward, and manages to be both exciting, and truly surprising at times. It's neither a moral lesson, nor a feel-good film, but works in so many levels, it can easily pass as either.\n\n\nA lot of interesting films go straight to DVD in Finland. The audiences here are so small that international films or anything reeking of art-house has to struggle to get a theatrical release. A lot of the most interesting films of the year thus end up straight to DVD. They also merit their very own list for that.\n\nBubbling under: Alien vs. Ninja, Killing Bono, Lemmy\n\n11. Troll Hunter (Trolljegeren)\nDirector: André Øvredal \n\nI'm betting subsequent viewings of this goofy handheld-shot fantasy film won't hold togather as well as the first. The best parts of the film are whenever trolls are revealed, which is a source of much comedy and \"ooh aah\" -feelings. It's a good sign that modern genre film makers have started to mine some lesser-used creatures than always the same vampires and zombies. So, while the film doesn't offer anything radically different it holds its own and entertains for the duration of the film. And also, the main Trollhunter in the film is a badass.\n10. The Trip\nDirector: Michael Winterbottom\n\nWinterbottom's films have tended to always be a sort of a mixed bag, and this road trip makes no difference. It's being sold as a comedy, and it stars the comedians Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon as themselves. But really, as the film goes along, the actual jokes diminish by the minute. At its core this is a melancholic look at middle-aged men. Coogan is successful but unhappy. Brydon is only known for a single joke, but he chooses to embrace this fame, and has a happy married life. Coogan in the middle of a crisis starts to loathe Brydon and tries wreck him at all possible points. Watch as Coogan tells Brydon to have more subtlety ih his impersonations. Brydon develops his initially apt Michael Caine -imitation to the point of bland. Coogan, who never had it in the first place, but he tries to add subtlety himself, and in the end makes a total fool of himself as he doesn't sound anything like his source material.\n\n9. Easy A \nDirector: Will Gluck\n\nI'm a sucker for a good John Hughes teen film. This comedy is a sort of tribute to them, in the sense that it also explicitly calls them out. But it's a charming one by itself as well. Emma Stone proves to be suitably dreamy, quircky and funny to pull off such a lead role. Her Olivia says a single lie about losing her virginity, and that snowballs to the point where everyone is asking her to lie for them. Aside the movie references, the film also refers to plenty of classic books everyone should read aduring the American High School. It doesn't offer wonders but for fans of adorable teenage girls and a funny romantic comedy, one could do a hell of a lot worse than this.\n\n8. Cell 211 (Celda 211)\nDirector: Daniel Monzón\n\nI've long held the stance that Con Air is the best action film of the 1990's. So, when a new, spanish action film imitates the plot of that classic, I'm bound to like it by default, right? In a high-security prison, a new prison guard gets caught inside as a big riot takes place. He has to fake to be a convict as well. He has to gain the trust of the riot leader, the intimidating Malamadre, if he wants to see his wife and children ever again. Another thing this film has in common are the heroic bloodshed and brotherhood-based Hong Kong action dramas of the late 80's, early 90's. The film has a few twists, and is not that easy to guess what's going on next. The end result is solid entertainment.\n\n7. Inside Job \nDirector: Charles Ferguson\n\nHere is a documentary film that should've had a premiere in Finland, as well as in any other country that is currently being ravaged by the financial crisis. It makes complex economical systems seem simple by going to the roots of all current finance problems. Watching it is also entertaining as well as infuriating, as some fat cats walk away from the fireball with their pockets lined with cash with no one stopping them. This sort of film should inspire Occupy Wall Street -movements everywhere in the world. Take the Power Back!\n\n6. Route Irish\nDirector: Ken Loach\n\nKen Loach has directed a familiar-seeming conspiracy thriller involving soldiers in the war against terrorism with his familiar, virtuoso skills. Loach has an eye to the local side of the war, to keep things interesting. But the best thing about the film are the way relationships between the film's characters are presented. They all border somewhere between utter love and ultimate contempt towards each other, and it's intriguing to see their tides shift back and forth. The backstory of the characters is told in the lines, not in flashbacks, and they colors the entire story in such a way that everything in the films feels more tragic for it. It's not the kind of social realism Loach excels in, but it's a captivating enough pseudo-thriller.\n\n5. I'm Still Here\nDirector: Casey Affleck\n\nThis is an odd, experimental film. Joaquin Phoenix is the American Jussi Parviainen in the sense that he's willing to wreck his entire life for the sake of entertainment. I'm not sure whether this is supposed to be a comedy, even though it is highly hilarious. A straight-out documentary it certainly is not. I think like Parviainen, Phoenix also forgot at some point where the limits of his performance end and his actual self began. Do we get to witness this breakdown here or just the performance we were meant to see? The viewer gets to be the judge. The film also works as a bitter letter to Hollywood and it's wide army of back-patters.\n\n4. Anvil! – The Story of Anvil\nDirector: Sacha Gervasi\n\nIt's a wonder that this film came to Finland so late, and without any big screen release. We are a big heavy metal country, and Anvil is a popular performer in the country. Perhaps the reason this only came out on DVD after it had gained a cult reputation is that it doesn't treat heavy metal or its fans with kid's gloves. It's a hard living, with pointless tours that earn little to no money for the artists. You get easily forgotten and shoved off the spotlight. The film shows all this with much hilairity. In fact, to make it as a rock star, one has to love playing rock more than anything other. The Anvil guys clearly do, and won't give up, no matter what hardships they have to face. That's why they've certainly earned their newfound fame.\n\n3. Exit Through The Gift Shop\nDirector: Banksy\n\nAnother film in which truth and fiction are hard to separate. But it's a good story and that should be sufficient enough. The film invites the viewer to ponder what exactly is art, who can be an artist, what does one have to do if he's an artist, and the most crucial of all, the commerial side of producing art. We Finns had to wait for this film so long, it's starting to get dangerously close to it's Best Before-date. But it's still a hugely hilarious film, no matter how much things keep changing in the art circles.\n\n2. Hobo with a Shotgun\nDirector: Jason Eisener\n\nLook, you either get it or you don't. You either find someone's head getting yanked off, or someone kicked to the back with an ice skate hilarious or you don't. And I happen to do. Some have complained that Hobo is nothing more than a bad re-hash of the Troma films of old. That's quite a handout for Troma. I wish that Troma films were as well directed, as inventive in their violence, and had someone even close to the charisma of Rutger Hauer as their lead. Either the budget is also a lot bigger in this, or the special effects have gone a lot cheaper since the late 80's, early 90's. Nevertheless, it also requires skill to use them in just the right way. Jason Eisener is black-hearted and mean-spirited enough to make a postmodern exploitation film that doesn't just laugh at the exploitation films of old. Rather, he works by the same principle: Be violent for real and entertain the audiences while doing so. And has thus delivered the funniest splatter film in ages.\n\n1. Blue Valentine \nDirector: Derek Cianfrance\n\nThis complex story is sold as a romantic film, and by that I can imagine it having caused more than its share of breakups around the world. It is a look at the arc that one couple goes through, and it intercuts between the past and the present to reveal intimate details and some sense of history repeating itself. At the same time as it is a story of a blossoming romance, it is also a story of a withering marriage and since the main characters in the both are same, it has a very gloomy sense of fate leading the characters. But also, the film invites to remember and to treasure the good moments and even the pain that love has caused. Without them the prize one gains from it would seem futile.\n\nThis is a raw, emotional film, that doesn't white-wash even the most dark aspects of a relationship. The frankness of the film are pulled by the amazing Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams who have never seemed to frail and vunerable on screen. They make the romance between the characters, as well as the falling out, believable. See it.\n\nTo be seen:\nDinner For Schmucks\n\nSo have a happy New Year, and in case I don't see you, also Easter, May Day, Midsummer's Eve, Thanksgiving, Christmas and Rise of Cthulhu! See you next year!\n\nNo comments:\n\nPost a Comment\n\n\nRelated Posts Plugin for WordPress, Blogger...",

        "text": "IRS Supervisor Clarifies Washington Role in Tax-Exempt Targeting\n\nSusan Walsh/AP file photo\n\nAn Internal Revenue Service supervisor at the center of the tax-exempt applications process that erupted in political scandal in May has contradicted agency assertions that the mishandling was confined to an office in Cincinnati, but she offered no evidence that top IRS or Obama administration officials directed the added scrutiny.\n\nAs reported by the Associated Press on Monday, Holly Paz, who recently left her Washington post as a top deputy in the exempt organizations division, told congressional interviewers she reviewed some 20-to-30 of the applications from tea party and other conservative groups whose applications were delayed.\n\nAccording to AP’s review, transcripts from the joint investigation by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee and the Ways and Means Committee show that “Paz described an agency in which IRS supervisors in Washington worked closely with agents in the field but didn’t fully understand what those agents were doing. Paz said agents in Cincinnati openly talked about handling `tea party’ cases, but she thought the term was merely shorthand for all applications from groups that were politically active -- conservative and liberal,” wrote reporter Stephen Ohlemacher.\n\nSix IRS staff have been interviewed so far by the committee. AP examined the transcripts of three of them, namely Paz, and the Cincinnati office's Gary Muthert and Elizabeth Hofacre.\n\n“It’s very fact-and-circumstance intensive. So it’s a difficult issue,” said Paz, who said the scrutiny began in February 2010. “Oftentimes what we will do, and what we did here, is we’ll transfer it to (the technical unit), get someone who’s well-versed on that area of the law working the case so they can see what the issues are,” the transcript said. “The goal with that is ultimately to develop some guidance or a tool that can be given to folks in (the Cincinnati office) to help them in working the cases themselves.”\n\nPaz added that her IRS colleagues are not political and were sorting the applications using the shorthand rhetoric of the groups under the assumption that it was for internal purposes only. “Because they are so apolitical, they are not as sensitive as we would like them to be as to how things might appear,” Paz said, according to the AP.\n\nMeanwhile, the interviewing continues to prompt partisan friction between House Oversight Chairman Darrell Issa, R-Calif., and Ranking Minority Member Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., over whether to release the transcripts in excerpts or in their entirety.\n\nOver the weekend, Issa said that as the interviews continue, \"We're learning about…officials who had reason to believe something was very wrong but tried keep that under wraps for as long as possible.” Cummings, who has threatened to release the full transcripts if Issa does not do so by Monday, said Issa was leaking\"cherry-picked excerpts that show no White House involvement whatsoever in the identification and screening of these cases.\"\n\nClose [ x ] More from GovExec",

It is quite  a prestigious competition and I’m sure I don’t stand an earthly chance of being selected and yet… there is a part of me now that says “where’s it written that you don’t stand a chance, why not?”.\nThis voice is gradually getting louder and for once has made all my other insecure voices start to fade.\n\nIf I don’t enter I definitely won’t stand a chance, so I’m going to give it a go.\n\n                                               ‘Seated Nude’ Conte Crayon\n\nI have been a bit grumpy today, I think it’s nerves. I can’t believe how long it took me to get them all framed up and ready, and to fill in all the application forms. It’s good experience.\nI also sold this on Monday\nHope it’s a good omen.\n\n11 thoughts on “Jumping In\n\n  1. HI just found your blog via the british mummy bloggers network – great to see there are quite a few artists. am very keen to get into NOTHS as someone said my work would go down well there. I do children's portraits – you can see my work on my website which is http://www.moyrascott.com. hmm really ought to link there from my blog at the very least eh! my son is 3 and so am just getting a bit of time to focus on this business idea. just got my first non friend of friend commission. so early days but am hopeful it will be a part of my portfolio career!\n\n  2. you just never know…certainly if you don't enter – glad you went ahead with it all. I recently submitted for a juried show – figured I wouldn't get in – and lo and behold – I did! along with all those \"real\" artists! And if it sells, I will hardly be able to contain myself!best of luck to you – keep us posted!amy of four corners design\n\n  3. get stuff done – Helloooo! good luck with it all :)amyd – well done you!Will definitely let you know what happens xSteve – sweet talker ;)Julie – Thanks for your encouragement, both here and on Flickr and Facebook. Getting my act together (framing etc) is no mean feat, ha ha!\n\n  4. How funny – my art student daughter was going to take one of hers to this, but opted out at the last minute as her best work was already in her degree show, saying 'nevermind – I'll win it next year.' The optimism of youth! Good for you for entering – hope you do well!\n\nLeave a Reply\n\n\nWordPress.com Logo\n\n\nGoogle+ photo\n\n\nTwitter picture\n\n\nFacebook photo\n\n\n\nConnecting to %s",

        "text": "Mining Photography [en]\nThe Ecological Footprint of Image Production\n\nPhotography has always depended on the extraction and exploitation of so-called natural raw materials. Having started out using copper, coal, silver, and paper—the raw materials of analogue image production in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries—photography now relies, in the age of the smartphone, on rare earths and metals like coltan, cobalt, and europium. The exhibition focuses on the history of key raw materials utilized in photography and establishes a connection between the history of their extraction, their disposal, and climate change. Looking at historical and contemporary works, it tells the story of photography as a history of industrial production and demonstrates that the medium is deeply implicated in human-induced changes to nature. The exhibition shows contemporary works by a range of photographers and artists, including Ignacio Acosta, Lisa Barnard, F&D Cartier, Susanne Kriemann, Mary Mattingly, Daphné Nan Le Sergent, Lisa Rave, Alison Rossiter, Metabolic Studio’s Optics Division, Robert Smithson, Simon Starling, Anaïs Tondeur, James Welling, Noa Yafe and Tobias Zielony, along with historical works by Eduard Christian Arning, Hermann Biow, Oscar and Theodor Hofmeister, Jürgen Friedrich Mahrt, Hermann Reichling, and others, and historical material from the Agfa Foto-Historama in Leverkusen, the Eastman Kodak Archive in Rochester and the FOMU Photo Museum in Antwerp as well as mineral samples collected by Alexander von Humboldt from the collection of the Museum für Naturkunde, Berlin. \n\nTexts: Siobhan Angus, Nadia Bozak, Boaz Levin, Christopher Lützen, Brett Neilson, Christoph Ribbat, Esther Ruelfs, Sven Schumacher, Karen Solie, Julia Wiedenmann\n\nEsther Ruelfs is an art historian and head of the Photography and New Media Collection at the Museum für Kunst und Gewerbe Hamburg (MK&G).

        "text": "DARPA's New Sniper Rifle Offers a Perfect Shot Across 12 Football Fields\n\nBy Joseph Calamia | May 25, 2010 2:23 pm\n\n\n\n\nTo meet that goal, engineers first had to figure out what to do about wind. The prototype gun can’t get rid of the wind, but it needs to correct for it. Otherwise, over long distances, the bullets will veer off course; DARPA notes that a 10 mph crosswind can produce a miss even at a distance of a quarter of a mile.\n\nThe One Shot sniper scope has a computer system that uses lasers to track not only distance, but also the wind turbulence in the path of the bullet. A set of crosshairs appears not in direct line with the gun’s barrel, but instead where the bullet will actually hit, and also displays the confidence of that shot.\n\nUS military trials have found that a laser beam shone on the target can do more than just determine the range: it can also be used to “measure the average down range crosswind profile”. The laser information can be combined with automatic readings of temperature, humidity etc and a “ballistic solution” computed. [The Register]\n\nBut there’s more work to be done on the One Shot system before it arrives in combat zones. These high-tech systems can’t require a lot of training or give off a lot of heat.\n\nWhat the agency really wants is a battle-ready system that doesn’t require tricky in-field optical alignment and fiddling with lasers. Night and day accuracy also means that the laser, which is used to help calculate and subtract wind turbulence between the predator and his prey, can’t be infrared. Enemies with night-vision goggles would see that from a mile away. [Wired]\n\nDARPA has just finished its first phases of the project, developing and testing the computer targeting system. Among other things, the next steps include making the system the right size and weight for battle, and completing some tweaks to the target crosshairs. With these improvements, according to a DARPA announcement this month, the Agency will ask for 15 “fully operational and field hardened systems” for field testing.\n\nRelated content:\n80beats: Police May Soon Use Pain Guns That Heat Skin With Microwaves\n80beats: MIT Team Uses 4,600 Informants to Win DARPA Scavenger Hunt\n\nImage: flickr / The U.S. Army\n\n\nDiscover's Newsletter\n\n\n\n\nSee More\n\nCollapse bottom bar",

        "text": "Costco, Easton Gateway\n\nProject Details\n\nColumbus, OH\nProduct Type\n\nThe new retail center was being developed in one of Central Ohio’s most exclusive shopping districts. While concrete masonry is the product of choice for such projects, ordinary architectural units would not provide the aesthetics required for this high-end project.\n\nThat’s why designers chose Spec-Brik®, a product that combines the timeless appearance of traditional brick with the construction economy of concrete masonry. According to Don Crites, Commercial Sales Manager for block producer Oberfields, Spec-Brik was a perfect fit for the colonial style brick commonly used in the upscale Easton Town Center.\n\n“Easton is the most successful and busiest shopping and entertainment district in the Columbus, Ohio area,” says Crites. “The development serves Northeast Columbus and municipalities to the east including New Albany, an exclusive residential community and home to a number of fashion retailers. Companies like Abercrombie and Fitch, Victoria’s Secret, and The Limited have their headquarters in this section of Ohio.”\n\nArchitectural firm MulvannyG2 Architecture based in Bellevue, WA designed the new Costco, the second location for the Columbus, OH metro area. “Oberfields has worked closely with this project’s architect on other developments including an earlier Costco project and a Target retail store,” says Crites. “For this project, we were actively involved offering submittal assistance, product advice, and helping with the color selections,” he says.\n\nThe new Costco, which opened in October 2013, consists of 35-thousand 8x4x16 Spec-Brik in a beautiful “Stanton Blend” color palette. Around 18-thousand traditional split-face and smooth color architectural block are also part of the design. They are in a Cobblestone and Buff Cream color. “The new Costco sits along the freeway side of the development, which offers a great deal of drive-by exposure,” says Crites. “The shopping campus also includes a Whole Foods and a Dick’s Sporting Goods.”\n\nAll of the concrete masonry used for this project is designed to resist water penetration. Every unit includes an integral water repellent admixture added by Oberfields during the production phase. In addition, most feature “Water Control Technology”, a physical modification that creates integral drainage zones to discourage water from crossing to the interior face shell. To further ensure water resistance, masonry contractor Casagrande Masonry utilized a special water repellent mortar during installation and a high-quality masonry sealer was applied post-contruction.\n\nThis new Costco is just one more example of how Spec-Brik can meet strict design standards and provide the cost-effective construction methods needed to ensure a profitable retail development.\n\nProject Gallery\n\nRequest Samples\n\nThe Concrete Products Group (CPG) is happy to provide qualified architects and designers product samples to meet design requirements.\n\nPlease provide your name and email address and we will contact you for shipping instructions.\n\n\nTo order, call 800-789-0872\n\nCopyright © , The Concrete Product Group, LLC, All Rights Reserved",

They're so easy to wear and they make any outfit look cooler. I love the casual feel of this blue one which makes for the perfect weekend look when paired with jeans and sneakers. And of course an off the shoulder top gives you the perfect opportunity to accessorize with a choker (or a bandana too). Shop off the shoulder tops below:\n\nNo comments:\n\nPost a Comment",

May help with heavy, painful periods.\n  • STI protection: No. Use condoms to help protect yourself from STIs\n  • Hormones: Yes. The implant releases the hormone progestogen\n\nHow does it work?\nThe implant works in three ways:\n\n  • It stops your ovaries releasing an egg every month.\n  • It thickens the mucus produced from your cervix. This makes it more difficult for the sperm to get to the egg.\n  • It thins the lining of the womb, making it less likely that a fertilised egg will implant in the womb.\n\nCan anything make the implant less effective?\nSome medicines may make an implant less effective. These include some of the medicines used to treat HIV, epilepsy and tuberculosis (TB), and the complementary medicine St John’s Wort. These are called enzyme-inducing drugs. If you take these medicines it will be recommended that you use additional contraception, such as condoms, or that you change to a different method of contraception.\n\nHow long can I use the implant for?\nEach implant will last for three years and will then need to be replaced. If you have no medical problems, you can continue to use the implant until you reach the menopause when contraception is no longer needed.\n\nCan anyone use an implant?\nMost women can have an implant fitted. An implant may not be suitable for you if:\n\n  • you think you might already be pregnant.\n  • you don’t want your periods to change.\n  • you take certain medicines.\n\nYou have now, or had in the past:\n\n  • arterial disease or history of serious heart disease or stroke\n  • disease of the liver\n  • breast cancer\n  • unexplained vaginal bleeding (for example, bleeding between periods or after sex).\n\nWhat are the advantages of an implant?\n\n  • It works for three years.\n  • You can use it if you’re breastfeeding.\n  • It may reduce heavy, painful periods\n\nWhat are the disadvantages of an implant?\n\n  • Your periods may change in a way that isn’t acceptable to you\n  • You may get temporary side effects when you first start using the implant. These should stop within a few months. They may include headaches, breast tenderness and mood changes.\n  • You may get acne or your acne may get worse.\n  • It requires a small procedure to fit and remove it.\n  • It doesn’t protect you against sexually transmitted infections, so you may need to use condoms as well.\n\nWhen can I start using an implant?\nYou can have an implant fitted at any time in your menstrual cycle if it’s certain that you’re not pregnant. If the implant is put in during the first five days of your period you’ll be protected from pregnancy immediately. If the implant is put in on any other day you won’t be protected from pregnancy for the first seven days after it’s been fitted. You’ll need to avoid sex or use additional contraception, such as condoms, during this time. If you are currently taking a combined pill or progestogen only pill, or using condoms, continue to take the pill, or to use condoms, consistently and correctly until one week after the implant is fitted. If you have recently had unprotected sex, please ring 0300 303 2880 to discuss emergency contraception.\n\nHow will an implant affect my periods?\nIt is common to have unscheduled bleeding in the first 3 months after having the implant fitted. Your periods will probably change.\n\n  • Most implant users will have irregular periods.\n  • In some implant users, periods will stop completely.\n  • Some implant users will have periods that last longer\n\nYour bleeding pattern may change at any time. This usually improves with time but may take 6 – 9 months to settle. These changes may be a nuisance but they’re not harmful. If you do have prolonged bleeding, we may be able to give you some additional hormones or medicine that can help control the bleeding.\n\nHow is the implant fitted and removed?\nThe implant is fitted under a local anaesthetic, so you should not feel any pain. However you may feel pushing and pulling as the implant is inserted.\nYour arm may be a little bruised for a couple of days but after that you can carry on all of your activities as normal. There is no need for a routine follow-up appointment. Once the implant is fitted you may need to use additional contraception for 7 days afterwards, depending on where you are in your cycle. The implant can be removed at any time which is easily done by numbing the arm with a local anaesthetic and making a tiny cut in your skin to gently pull the implant out.\n\nImplant exchanges or removals\nPlease ensure both ends of the implant can be easily felt. If your implant cannot be felt, please ring 0300 303 2880 to discuss further as you may need to be seen in a specialist clinic.\nIf you are having your implant removed, your fertility will return to normal as soon as the implant is removed and you could get pregnant without ongoing contraception. If you do not want to become pregnant, you should use another method of contraception from the day your implant is removed. For further information:\n\nIf you have any further questions please call 0300 303 2880 to discuss further. Further\ninformation on implants:\n\nContact bSHaW on 0300 303 2880 to make an appointment",

        "text": "Thursday, June 29, 2006\n\nSeen God?\n\nAn often asked question. Seen God?\n\nWhat is God? Who is God? Is it a He or She? How does He/She look?\n\nThere are no definitive answers to any of the above questions.\n\nToday I saw God. Not a statue, not a book written about him, but God, in flesh and blood!\n\nToday morning, I went to the kapaleeshwarar temple in Mylapore built for Lord Shiva. I went at my usual time, 8:30 a.m. I made my usual rounds in the temple and came to the praharam (sanctum sanctorum) of Lord Shiva. The Archana was going on and hence the curtains were drawn. I could not see the Shiva Lingam. I was waiting for about 10 minutes for the curtains to be drawn but it didn’t seem like it was going to be.\n\nI was just preparing to turn back and head home, when a hand tapped me on the shoulder. I turned back and saw an old man, a man whom I had met a year back before I left for Dubai.\n\nNow I have mixed feelings about this man. The first time I met him I was under a lot of stress mentally. I was going through a tough period in my job. In order to take my mind away from it all, I used to visit the temple and empty all my burden on God. I prayed for long hours asking for many things and praying things would all turn out OK.\n\nDuring one such visit, when I was stepping out of the Karpagambal’s praharam, I met this old man for the first time. He steps in front of me and very gently enquired “Did you have a good darshan?” I replied in the affirmative. He looked at me and said just one more sentence. “Don’t ask her for anything, she knows what is right and what is wrong for you. You just go in and let your mind free. She will take care of the rest”. He then went in to the Shiva temple and got me a special flower used during the prayers called “Vilva Poo”. He said, “Today is a good day to come to the temple, I am sure you will be a happy person soon”. This chance meeting and that one sentence of his when I was stepping out of the Goddess’s shrine, stunned me.\n\nBut I also considered him a little bit of a con man, for the simple reason that after all this talk about God and one’s well being, at the end of it all he would ask for whatever monetary contribution possible to feed hungry Brahmins. I never bought that story because instinctively I felt he wasn’t entirely truthful. But I used to give him what I could for his ‘noble cause’. Moreover the couple of times that I met him, it has always been only at moments like these when I was about to miss seeing the God and never any time else.\n\nAgain this time around just when I was about to turn around and leave without seeing God, he said “you waited for 10 minutes, wait for another 10 seconds and the curtains will open”.\n\nSure enough the curtains were drawn in 10 seconds! I had a good Darshan and what’s more the old man got me that special flower again, the ‘Vilva Poo’ used during Lord Shiva’s archana.\n\nHe did not ask me for the customary monetary contribution for his anna danam to Brahmins. Probably he had forgotten me. He was an old man after all and I was meeting him after 1 year! I don’t know what made me ask him how he was and how his family was. I also don’t know what made me ask him how his anna danam (food distribution) for hungry Brahmins was going on. I don’t know what made me give him Rs. 50/- towards his noble cause, whether he did it or not I care less. But I felt happiness in my heart. I felt light.\n\nNow atheists would call this chance meeting, coincidence. I like to call it the touch of God. It was God’s way of reaching out to me. The old man was the channel.\n\nWho was it for you?\n\n\nAnonymous said...\n\n\nAnonymous said...\n\nPlease do us all a favour and stop writing Blogs!!!!\n\nRamanu said...\n\nKeep on Vinay, u are doing a good job!\n\nHot Chocolate said...\n\nHey dude..definitely not one of your best :)))\n\nAnonymous said...\n\nSometimes the most unexpected things happen when you least expect it. If it leaves a good feeling it is because of our way of looking at things positively. As long as you do not tie-up such incidences to blind faith, you are ok. But if you get carried away then you will find yourself permanently needing a prop called God.\nWhile I don't deny that we need to have an attitude of gratitude, even God needs a break!\n\nAnonymous said...\n\nMan lives on hope. Call it God or by any other name. If somthing give us that little bit to get on by, then why not? This is good news for tired, hopeful hearts. I wouldnt dismiss it in a hurry! Minu",

        "text": "Greenland Could Become Greater Contributor To Sea Level Rise Than Previously Expected\n\n\nUniversity of California – Irvine\n\nMajor UCI-NASA work reveals long, deep valleys connecting ice cap to the ocean\n\nGreenland’s icy reaches are far more vulnerable to warm ocean waters from climate change than had been thought, according to new research by UC Irvine and NASA glaciologists. The work, published May 18 in Nature Geoscience, shows previously uncharted deep valleys stretching for dozens of miles under the Greenland Ice Sheet.\n\nThe bedrock canyons sit well below sea level, meaning that as subtropical Atlantic waters hit the fronts of hundreds of glaciers, those edges will erode much further than had been assumed and release far greater amounts of water.\n\nIce melt from the subcontinent has already accelerated as warmer marine currents have migrated north, but older models predicted that once higher ground was reached in a few years, the ocean-induced melting would halt. Greenland’s frozen mass would stop shrinking, and its effect on higher sea waters would be curtailed.\n\n“That turns out to be incorrect. The glaciers of Greenland are likely to retreat faster and farther inland than anticipated – and for much longer – according to this very different topography we’ve discovered beneath the ice,” said lead author Mathieu Morlighem, a UCI associate project scientist. “This has major implications, because the glacier melt will contribute much more to rising seas around the globe.”\n\nTo obtain the results, Morlighem developed a breakthrough method that for the first time offers a comprehensive view of Greenland’s entire periphery. It’s nearly impossible to accurately survey at ground level the subcontinent’s rugged, rocky subsurface, which descends as much as 3 miles beneath the thick ice cap.\n\nSince the 1970s, limited ice thickness data has been collected via radar pinging of the boundary between the ice and the bedrock. Along the coastline, though, rough surface ice and pockets of water cluttered the radar sounding, so large swaths of the bed remained invisible.\n\nMeasurements of Greenland’s topography have tripled since 2009, thanks to NASA Operation IceBridge flights. But Morlighem quickly realized that while that data provided a fuller picture than had the earlier radar readings, there were still major gaps between the flight lines.\n\nTo reveal the full subterranean landscape, he designed a novel “mass conservation algorithm” that combined the previous ice thickness measurements with information on the velocity and direction of its movement and estimates of snowfall and surface melt.\n\nThe difference was spectacular. What appeared to be shallow glaciers at the very edges of Greenland are actually long, deep fingers stretching more than 100 kilometers (almost 65 miles) inland.\n\n“We anticipate that these results will have a profound and transforming impact on computer models of ice sheet evolution in Greenland in a warming climate,” the researchers conclude.\n\n“Operation IceBridge vastly improved our knowledge of bed topography beneath the Greenland Ice Sheet,” said co-author Eric Rignot of UC Irvine and NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. “This new study takes a quantum leap at filling the remaining, critical data gaps on the map.”\n\nOther co-authors are Jeremie Mouginot of UC Irvine and Helene Seroussi and Eric Larour of JPL. Funding was provided by NASA.\n\nThe team also reported stark new findings last week on accelerated glacial melt in West Antarctica. Together, the papers “suggest that the globe’s ice sheets will contribute far more to sea level rise than current projections show,” Rignot said.\n\nSource: RedOrbit\n\nOne Response to Greenland Could Become Greater Contributor To Sea Level Rise Than Previously Expected\n\nAdd Comment Register\n\nLeave a Reply\n\n\n\n\nGet every new post delivered to your Inbox\n\nJoin other followers",

        "text": "10 Homeschooling Fears and How To Conquer Them\n\n\n\n10. It's all on.....you.\n\nThe hard part: Who do you blame when your kid isn’t grasping the concept? You can’t blame the teacher (well, you can but you’ll just feel bad about it.)\n\nOn the bright side: Being the one to take responsibility for teaching and learning might show your children how to do the same. You can’t pass it off to someone else, you need to to take some initiative (and so do they.)\n\n9. There's no one right way to learn at home.\n\nThe hard part: No matter how many people tell you about their awesome curriculum, it might not work for you. There won’t be one right way to school or one great curriculum to solve all your lesson planning needs. You can think of homeschooling as an ice cream bar with lots of different toppings - no two sundaes will end up being alike (good - plain vanilla....how boring!)\n\nOn the bright side: You don’t have anyone bossing you around, telling you exactly what curriculum your child should be using. Exploring all the ways and types of homeschooling can be a great learning experience in itself.\n\n8. You'll fail, a lot, in front of your kids.\n\nThe hard part: Yep, you will learn that you don’t know everything. Your kids will learn that you don’t know everything, you might appear dumb to them (maybe more than once.)\n\nOn the bright side: Showing that you are willing to learn with your children and handling your imperfections with grace will show your kids how to accept their own failures. No one knows everything and everyone will fail at something, knowing that you can learn from mistakes and go on is a great lesson.\n\n7. Everyone will ask about ‘socialization.’\n\nThe hard part: You’ll wish that Webster never defined socialization after total strangers imply that your kids are going to grow up weird after spending all their time with you.\n\nOn the bright side: You might dread the question, but after homeschooling for awhile you will love the social benefits. (Plus, after hearing the question a million times it gets easier to answer!)\n\n6. You will be judged by people who have just met you.\n\nThe hard part: You will suddenly become an object of close scrutiny when people hear the words ‘home’ and ‘school’ come out of your mouth. You will be judged accordingly by them (based on how many of these so called ‘homeschoolers’ they know in real life.)\n\nOn the bright side: You might (I said might..) be the normal homeschooler that they have never met. If you care about what other people think, this could be a really hard thing for you. If you care more about doing what is right for your family, you’ll be fine.\n\n5. People you've known for years will judge you too.\n\nThe hard part: Friends and family might nominate you for an intervention. Get ready for Holiday dinners where you and your ‘ridiculous decision to homeschool’ are going to be the topic of conversation.\n\nOn the bright side: Well, it does make for a lively conversation. When your children go on to do amazing things - they might eat their words.\n\n4. Kitchen tables are for eating?\n\nThe hard part: Do you remember what the table looked like? Good, because once you start piling high science experiments, books and art projects you might never see the table top again.\n\nOn the bright side: There will come a day when there won’t be anymore blue fingerprints on the table, the books will no longer contain only pictures and the messes will cease. But, you won’t have missed a moment of it.\n\n3. It will get expensive.\n\nThe hard part: If you start hiding curriculum in the pantry and start thinking that going to a homeschool fair is more fun that getting a spa treatment...you will have succeumbed to homeschool curriculitis. You’ll start justifying the money you spend on materials because it’s for your child’s education.\n\nOn the bright side: You will find that you don’t need every new thing that comes out, that the library can be your best friend, that you don’t have to re-invent the wheel, and that you don’t have to spend every dime on materials either. Some of the stuff you buy can make your job easier (and there will be plenty of time to pamper yourself when the kids move out - you can sell all that curriculum to some other needy homeschooler!)\n\n2. Meeting other homeschoolers will be work.\n\nThe hard part: Yes, it will be work meeting other homeschoolers and introducing your children to new friends without help from a school. It will mean that you seek out opportunities to fellowship with others, build relationships and take time to get together with fellow homeschoolers, neighborhood kids and kids from after school activities.\n\nOn the bright side: Since there are no grade levels at park day, your children can play with and interact with children in every age bracket. They will get to experience a diverse group of friends (just like they would in the real world.)\n\n1. You'll want an open mind.\n\nThe hard part: What does homeschooling mean to you? You’ll have to get rid of preconceived notions about education and learning at home. Don’t expect to lay a path and follow it the whole way through, plans change, kids change, you might need to change too.\n\nOn the bright side: Oh come on, you get to be with your kids every day, to see them struggle and learn. You get to rejoice in their triumphs and carry them through their trials. Keeping an open mind will make you a better teacher and show your children that you can both travel this path together.\n\n\nPlease log in or register to add your comment",

But then they fell from the sky, putting the fate of all worlds in danger. And now three women and three men join forces to pick up the pieces... Sasha Riggs is a reclusive artist, haunted by dreams and nightmares that she turns into extraordinary paintings. Her visions lead her to the Greek island of Corfu, where five others have been lured to seek the fire star. Sasha recognizes them, because she has drawn them: a loner. All on a quest. All with secrets. Sasha is the one who holds them together the seer. And in the magician, Bran Killian, she sees a man of immense power and compassion. As Sasha struggles with her rare ability, Bran is there to support her, challenge her, and believe in her. But Sasha and Bran are just two of the six. And they all must work together as a team to find the fire star in a cradle of land beneath the sea. Over their every attempt at trust, unity, and love, a dark threat looms. And it seeks to corrupt everything that stands in its way of possessing the stars.\"Provided by publisher.\n\n    Riggs, Sasha painajaiset unet maalaukset kohtalo matkat rakkaus tuntemattomat taiteilijat taikurit Korfu\n\n    ENG EISBN:9780698190733",

The head helps support powerful jaw muscles that allow the turtles to crush shellfish. Loggerheads eat shellfish, jellyfish, mussels, shrimp, and other marine animals.\n\n\nWednesday, May 26, 2010\n\nKeep them Learning this Summer\n\nSummer begins for us this week, I have a little game plan for some summer learning.\n\nTo keep our writing skills sharp we are playing with Sidewalk chalk, writing letters, names and any other words we want. This is usually followed by a crazed coloring frenzy and a little discussion( dare I say fight) over who gets to spray the water to wash it off.\n\nWe also plan on writing some letters to family and friends, I found some sweet \"G\" cards. I am excited to see what fun stories G wants to write about.\n\nScience will be explored by learning about the planets! I found some great Beginner readers from Scholastic books about the planets!\nMy sister in law also gave me a great website on Science to do at home HERE! They sell different kits but also at the bottom of the page are links to the Top 10 Science Experiments the first it the Mentos/Diet Coke. Check out the Corn Starch GOO Wow we are ready to explore maybe we should get some sweet white coats! *hint hint* if you see any!\n\nReading- I have been stocking up on a few new books from Scholastic and am using a website that was referred to me by G's preschool teacher called .I found magnets with \"Site Words\" on them at Wal Mart by a company called Active Minds\n\nArt/Hands On G Love's foam stickers, if you have received any art from her lately you will have noticed this trend. I found a Butterfly and an Ocean Pack of foam stickers for her to work on. Watch out world hear we come!\n\nPudding Painting, I love to paint with pudding, I just make up an instant pack of vanilla, divide it up into different bowls add different colors and we have edible paint for all!

These selected experiences—jointly designed by IM and CVD program directors at the pilot sites—will lead to and contribute to competencies and credits required for both IM and CVD training during this third year. Trainees in the pilot program will sit for the ABIM IM certification exam at the end of their third year of training.\n\nProgram Goals:\n\n  • To assess a competency-based (CB) curriculum for CVD training\n  • To pilot—in conjunction with IM—aspects of a curriculum aimed at an earlier career focus for CVD education through new and unique competency-based rotations. It is not the intent of this pilot to create a different type of cardiologist; rather, the intent is to examine the pathway by which one becomes a competent cardiologist.\n\nCurrent Participants:\n\nEach pilot site is led by both the IM and CVD training program directors, with additional oversight being provided by a competency or promotions committee comprising the training program directors and two faculty members each from IM and CVD to review assessment data and provide attestation of trainee competence.\n\nThe four institutions currently participating in the pilot program are:\n\n  • Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai\n  • Indiana University School of Medicine\n  • University of Oklahoma College of Medicine\n  • Vanderbilt University School of Medicine\n\nThe pilot began in July 2014 and four pilot residents successfully completed their training at the end of June 2015 and started their CVD fellowship training in July 2015. The second year of the pilot started in July 2015 at the four participating institutions. The total duration of IM and CVD fellowship is six years for the pilot trainees.\n\nFor Additional Information:\n\nIf you would like more information about this pilot program, contact Dr. C.A. Sivaram at or Robyn Snyder, ACC Director of Education Design, at",

The simple answer is that we don’t know.\nMany say we could never default on our national debt. But Republicans and Democrats are using the “default card” as leverage to get what they want.\nRepublicans want to freeze the debt level, and Democrats want to raise the debt ceiling. Both have threatened to let the debt default if they don’t get their way.\nRobert Shapiro, of the Daily Beast, states, “Trillions of dollars in U.S. Treasury securities are held by financial institutions here and abroad, so the default would quickly freeze capital markets around the world. Private lending to businesses and households here and in many other nations would halt. The reserves held by many of the world’s central banks also include trillions of dollars in U.S. Treasuries, so a U.S. default also could quickly bring on a global financial crisis that would dwarf the chaos of late-2008.”\nCountries like Greece, Portugal and Spain are at the verge of involuntary default.\nAccording to economists, when a nation’s debt equals or surpasses its gross domestic product (economic output), it usually means that a downward economic spiral is imminent.\nLike Greece, Spain’s economy is on the brink of imploding. The Associated Press reports: “The Spanish government debt rose to 75.9 percent of its economy in the second quarter of 2012, according to figures published by the Bank of Spain. Over 350,000 Spaniards have received eviction notices since the housing bubble burst five years ago. In Spain, tenants who are evicted are still liable for huge payments. Banks have the authority to garnish wages if necessary.”\nThe United States has the largest debt of any country in the world. Could our government crumble to levels that would require radical measures to keep it from going bankrupt?\nAs of July, $5.3 trillion, or approximately 48 percent of the $16 trillion debt held by the public, was owned by foreign investors, the largest of which were China and Japan, at just over $1.1 trillion each. What if a global crisis necessitates foreign creditors to suddenly demand payment for total balance due? Think about what the creditors would demand if we couldn’t pay that debt in American dollars.\nWhat assets would we have that could be used to pay that debt? Gold reserves? Print more money? So much would be printed that it would render the dollar worthless.\nHow about military arms? What about raising taxes? Sorry, still not close. How would the Chinese react if we told them we couldn’t pay?\nChina continues to build silent-running nuclear attack submarines and continues to increase its nuclear first-strike capabilities.\nCould China be preparing for a global economic crisis?\n\nGeorge Pikoulas\nCenter Township\nOrder Photos!\narrow Comply\narrow Keep junior high open\narrow Harsh interrogation OK\narrow Accident closes westbound Route 422\narrow Motorist in crash that killed officer dies\narrow Victim in fatal home fire identified\narrow Icy roads cause several traffic accidents",

The preference-performance hypothesis and parent-offspring conflict in aboveground-belowground herbivore life cycles\n\nResearch output: Contribution to journalArticle\n\n\n\nPublication details\n\nJournalEcological entomology\nDatePublished - Apr 2011\nIssue number2\nNumber of pages8\nPages (from-to)117-124\nOriginal languageEnglish\n\n\n2. This study investigated the factors influencing the performance of the root-feeding vine weevil (Otiorhynchus sulcatus) larvae and whether this was linked to the oviposition behaviour of the maternal adult living aboveground.\n\n3. Maternal insects feeding aboveground reduced root biomass by 34% and increased root carbon by 4%. Larvae feeding on plants subjected to aboveground herbivory had reduced mass. Irrespective of the presence of maternal herbivory, larval mass was positively correlated with root biomass.\n\n4. Larval mass was also reduced by conspecific larvae, previously feeding on roots (19% reduction). However, the mechanism underpinning this effect remains unclear, as in contrast to maternal herbivory aboveground, prior larval feeding did not significantly affect root biomass or root carbon concentrations.\n\n5. Maternal insects did not distinguish between plants infested with larvae and those that were free of larvae, in terms of their egg-laying behaviour. Conversely, maternal insects tended to lay eggs on plants with smaller root systems, a behaviour that is likely to negatively affect offspring performance.\n\n6. The PPH is not supported by our findings for the polyphagous vine weevil feeding on the host plant raspberry (Rubus idaeus), and in fact our results suggest that there is the potential for strong parent-offspring conflict in this system.\n\nDiscover related content\n\n\nView graph of relations",

Don't miss these!\n\n60-Day Money-Back Guarantee:\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nHow are Black Tulip brushes made?\n\nThere's a complex manual process behind making each brush, and all the methods require high precision and years of experience. Let us try to give you a general overview of how these beautiful brushes are made:\n\n  • A ZenART Black Tulip brush is handcrafted with a brush handle made of genuine and exquisite lacquered birch wood and seven layers of UV coating. The bristles are manually formed using different techniques for specific shapes, tightly tied, combed, gripped by a non-rust nickel ferrule, glued with a precise injection of special glue. After drying, the ferrule holding the bristles is double-crimped to the handles to fasten securely. The brushes are then inspected again to remove any ‘floating shorts' —bristles which may sometimes remain, especially in larger sized brushes or round shapes, and cause initial ‘shedding' during breaking in period. After a thorough inspection, the brushes are then protected and sized before getting packed.\nHow soft are these brushes?\n\nThese brushes are soft yet springy, and keep their shape well without compromise. We use Japanese synthetic hair fibers to mimic qualities of natural soft bristles, for that crisp, smooth detailing; extensively tested for their professional performance.\n\nHowever, if you prefer natural brushes, you can take a look at our Turner brush set or other lines of faux synthetic hair and natural hair blends.\n\nHow durable are these brushes?\n\nThese brushes are ‘trained' to maintain their shape even after heavy use and provide consistent control whatever art project you're working on. Using elegant seven-times-lacquered birch wood short handles allows for a luxurious feeling of unrivalled balance, particularly during intricate and exacting strokes. The use of high-quality faux squirrel bristles on these brushes also made them very sturdy. And of course, they'll last even longer if you take good care of them.\n\nHow much water can these brushes hold?\n\nThese brushes are resistant to heavy use and can hold a significant amount of water to allow you to get the perfect results for your paintings. The faux squirrel synthetic fibers lay down a good, even wash. Therefore, many professional artists were pleasantly surprised and compared our Black Tulip collection brushes with the squirrel and kolinsky sable performance in a much more affordable yet surprisingly effective set.\n\nAre these brushes suitable for beginners?\n\nYes! These brushes are high quality, and many professional artists praise them for their fantastic performance, thoughtful variety of shapes and sizes specifically designed for water-based media. When it comes to art materials and tools, a famous saying among the artists and the art tutors is that ‘One should buy the best quality one can afford.' It's so true, especially for beginner artists, who are still building up their confidence and knowledge of techniques. The best art tools will help accelerate progress and keep you motivated to paint and experiment with new techniques.\n\nConsidering the value for money we offer for such an extensive artist-quality set, including the guides, tutorials and advice, you'll make a significant long-term gift for yourself or other artists, whether beginners to advanced and professionals.\n\nHow do you protect the brushes?\n\nIn order to bring you the best quality brushes intact we apply special protective solution to keep the tips of the brushes in the original shape.\n\nWe also wrap the brushes in transparent films, and it's done to protect and waterproof the brushes for transit. We want to make sure that you receive your brush set in its best state, wherever you are in the world.\n\nIt also serves as a seal of guarantee to our customers and our return department that the brushes have never been used before. In some cases, we experience customers returning used brushes and these are not re-sold. Having these plastic films ensures that you received a brand-new set.\n\nHow do I clean and care for these brushes?\n\nOur Black Tulip collection brushes are easy to clean and maintain:\n\n  • For new brushes: First, always remove the transit solution by washing the brushes with mild soap and lukewarm water. Slightly massage between the bristles on the palm of your hand, letting any floating bristles to be washed away, if any, especially in large sized-brushes.\n  • For regular cleaning or every after painting: Clean the brushes well with soap every after use—before the paint dries— to avoid damage from paint build-up at the base of the ferrule. Do not push the brushes too hard into your palms.\n  • We recommend using vegetable oil-based soap, gentle to the bristles and your skin.\n  • After rinsing thoroughly, use a microfiber or other absorbent towel to remove excess water.\n  • Gently reshape the bristles with your fingers, and let it dry naturally on a horizontal or flat surface.\n\nBrush Care Tips:\n\n  • Never leave the brushes soaked in water, as this will ruin your brushes and cause damage to the bristles, glue and handle.\n  • From time to time, and for optimum results, you can apply a special lanolin-based brush conditioner (optional), for TLC and extra longevity of your brushes.\n  • Follow our recommended cleaning guide above to reduce possible initial ‘break-in shedding', which might be just short bristles not glued inside the ferrule that are trapped between the longer bristles.\n  • After washing and drying, always gently reshape the bristles with your fingers, and let it dry naturally on a horizontal or flat surface.\n  • Shedding: It is natural for brushes to shed lightly. Minimal shedding is common especially while you break them in. To reduce problems of shedding, ZenART has crafted these watercolour brushes with faux squirrel synthetic fibers. The brushes lose fewer bristles and normally don't shed at all. In rare occasions, it might happen, and such cases are significantly less compared to other ones on the market. Reasons can be any of the following:\n    • Using brushes before removing the transit solution\n    • Harsh “breaking-in” of new brushes. We suggest trying the above method of cleaning, drying horizontally, and gently removing any floating bristles while dry, before giving up on your brushes.\n    • Misuse and ruining of the brushes due to harsh chemicals, abrasive surfaces, soaking brushes in water or other solution, vertically letting them stand and loosening the glue.\n    • In extreme cases, manufacturing defects, when not enough glue was applied and the brush (losing bristles long enough to be potentially glued in the ferrule, not floating shorts). In such situations, we are here to support you, too, and offer our help to resolve any issues.\nAre these brushes short or long-handled?\n\nThe Black Tulip collection brushes are short-handled for full expression with water-based paints: watercolour, gouache, inks, and dyes. They have been specifically designed, weighted and balanced for precise horizontal painting and avoiding any hand fatigue or poking in your eye. The exquisite birch wood brush set also has seven layers of UV coating to prevent flaking, and provide slip & wear resistance.\n\nWhat if I am not happy with these brushes?\n\n\nCustomer Reviews\n\nBased on 914 reviews\nHarriet d.W.\nLove Cats Tongue Brush\n\nThis is a very versatile brush and it is so easy to use it and transition from thin to thick lines.\n\nJudge.me YouTube video placeholder\n\nThe delivery was fast and reliable.

(Frinton-on-Sea, GB)\nVegan paintbrushes\n\nBeautiful brushes that make it so easy to paint, thank you\n\nThank you so much for writing us this review We truly appreciate it. :)- Ryan\n\n\nTruly outstanding brush quality, extraordinary price , and a noteworthy company -- and that is despite having a significant issue with my order. Let me explain... I am new to watercolor (as in only discovered this medium about 8 weeks ago), but I quickly learned *the quality of your artwork is directly proportional to the quality of your tools* If you paint with chalky cheap paints, your art will look chalky and cheap. If your paper is not high quality, your art will not be either. And no matter how clever your hands, you MUST have a decent brush to make the marks you want. I bought the proper quality pigments, an acceptable cotton paper, but was struggling to find decent AND affordable watercolor brushes. When I found ZenArt's Tulip Brush set, I honestly worried they were too good to be true. But... they were the best I could find in our price range, so my husband gave them to me as an anniversary gift. I was SO excited when they arrived. Seriously giddy. My hopes were immediately dashed however. * 5 out of 6 of these brushes had extremely loose ferrules. I could twist them fully around and even bend one almost 5° within the ferrule! I was devastated. I contacted the company immediately. Within 24 hours, Ryan, from ZA responded personally. He explained that this is rare, and that ZenArt took their product's quality and customer's satisfaction very seriously. They would send me a new set ASAP. In the meantime, I could do what I wanted with the defective originals. Well, of course, I decided to try them out while I waited. I just had to be cognizant of the wobbly handles and hold the brush more like a pencil. The unfinished painting of the lake/canoe (above) is one I did with the original wobbly set. So far, not bad, but I will get into that more below. Today is the first day I have had the new set and the half completed dog painting in my sketchbook is being done solely with the new Tulip set. I am letting a section dry atm, and am so overwhelmed by how well these brushes perform, I just had to review them now. Now that you know about the loose ferrule issue, here are my other observations... 1. The brushes keep their shape beautifully. Seriously, they snap back together instantly. One of the wobbly rounds fell from its drying position overnight onto its tip (I know, cue the panic!). It dried bent. I rewetted it first thing that next morning and it stayed bent (eek!). So I drenched the bristles in Gum Arabic solution and gently rolled it back into position, let it dry, and voilà! Good as new ever since. 2. The tips are perfect fine points. The rounds, rigger and cat's tongue have astonishingly fine points. Easily able to produce thick smooth marks with a little pressure or fine lines with only a little finesse. After over a month of near daily use (and even some incidental abuse) the points are still perfect. 3. Not a single bristle has fallen out. And thats with the ferrule issue. 4. They hold a lot of water and release it smoothly. I don't have any fancier brushes to compare to, but more than once I've been amazed at just how much pigment these brushes can hold before you must reload. Yet they also dry very nicely, even over some of the humid days we've had this summer. 5. The flat brushes snap back into place immediately as well, with very little splitting. If you want to paint a perfect swatch, these are your brushes. The edges of the flats, too, make fine lines exactly as you want. 6. Finally, as to the loose ferrules, those even snugged up with use, so the brushes can be held more loosely and they hardly wobble at all. I am not sure they will fit so nicely once the humidity is gone this winter, but for now, they are exemplary despite this defect. I am glad I decided to wait to review these brushes, because I needed time to realize that they absolutely deserve 5 stars. Even despite the defects, this watercolor brush set is outstanding for beginning watercolorists. The brushes are forgiving for minor errors, and make absolutely lovely marks on the paper when you need them to. I look forward to expanding my ZenArt supplies, because this company is doing it right. Mistakes happen to everyone, but not everyone handles them with as much integrity as ZA does. And these brushes are absolutely amazing. Thanks you, Zen Art!\n\nWow, we were blown away by your positive words, we really appreciate the time you took to write such a detailed review. - Ryan\n\nThese brushes hold a lot of bang for your buck!\n\nAs a newbie watercolorist I found these brushes via a review video on youtube and was so impressed with how they handled I had to buy them for myself. These brushes do not disappoint. They're almost - if not better - than the black velvet brushes I've recently purchased. They hold a lot of water, are easy to hold and they put paint to paper really well. Not only that, the brush variations are a perfect starter brush set for people looking for good brushes that get the job done at an affordable price. On top of all of the above, the package included a card where you could request a free gift direct from ZenArt - a sketch book - which I ended up requesting. The customer service with Zenart is really lovely and I was super excited by how quickly the sketch book arrived after requesting. Definitely will be back to purchase more supplies from this company and will be recommending them to any and all friends looking for fabulous brushes!\n\n\nCindy S.\nLong lasting & affordable\n\nOne of my favourite buys ever is this set of watercolour brushes... I've had them for over two years now and they're still amazing... I've only had to buy one additional brush for tiny line work and that's it... love the set!!! It fantastic quality, but still affordable to the not rich...\n\nLove your #7 brush\n\nI love your black tulip number 7 round brush. I don't know why but it has magical effects on my paper.\n\nAlex G. (Cambridge, GB)\n\nSuperb brushes for all levels of creative artists. I found reviews and new to art I hadn’t been happy with the previous brushes. These are my go to brushes and are always packed for journeys.\n\nSpecial Discounts",

What do we identify as significant markers as we move through it? What defines us? Yes, a bit introspective today, yet I can say unequivocally, writing is part of what defines me. All who show up at the ‘Edge each week to link words penned by their characters and muses and life events, all lay claim to writing as one of those “markers’. Please join us this week for the telling of tales in 6 and precisely 6 sentences and leave your mark for perpetuity, here in the halls of Six Sentence Stories.\n\nRules of the hop:\nWrite 6 Sentences. No more. No less.\nUse the current week’s prompt word.\nLink is live Wednesday through Saturday night late!\n\n\nYou are invited to the Inlinkz link party!\n\nClick here to enter\n\nI can’t write five words but that I change seven. – Dorothy Parker\n\n10 thoughts on “It’s Six Sentence Story Thursday Link Up!\n\nLeave a Reply\n\n\nYou are commenting using your account.

        "text": "I have a new blog!\n\nGot Eclipse for PHP up running with XDebug\n\nGot Eclipse for PHP up running now, with XDebug. Yay :) It was a snap to install on my Ubuntu box. I basically followed this and this blog post. (The Ubuntu package for XDebug is php5-xdebug).\n\nThe Eclipse dialogs had changed location and structure a little, so for my documentation, I included a screenshot of the dialog under \"Run > Debug configurations\" below.\n\nNSF soon requiring data management plans\n\nInteresting: \"Scientists Seeking NSF Funding Will Soon Be Required to Submit Data Management Plans\". Is this a new trend? If so, it should be an area where Bioclipse can help, I gues, not least through the planned ability to export semantic data to a Semantic MediaWiki (That will require me to finish my GSoC first, though).\n\nProlog query much faster when mimicking SPARQL\n\nI reported earlier that Jena/SPARQL outperformed Prolog for a lookup query with some numerical value comparison. It later on turned out that the results were flawed and finally that Prolog indeed was the fastest as soon as turning to datasets with more than a few hundred peaks.\n\nThe Prolog program I was using was rather complicated with recursive operations on double lists etc. Then, some week ago, I tried, in order to highlight differences in expressivity between Prolog and SPARQL, to implement a Prolog query that mimicked the structure of the SPARQL query I used, as close as possible. Interestingly it turned out that this Prolog query can be optimized to become blazing fast by reversing the order of shift values to search for, so that the largest values are searched for first. With this optimization the query outperforms both the SPARQL and the earlier used prolog code. See figure 1 below for results (The new prolog query is named \"SWI-Prolog Minimal\"). It appears that the querying time does not even increase with the number of triples in the RDF store!\n\nFigure 1: Spectrum similarity search comparison: SWI-Prolog vs. JenaFigure 1: Spectrum similarity search comparison: SWI-Prolog vs. Jena\n\nThe explanation seems to stem from the fact that larger NMR Shift values are in general more unique than smaller values (see histogram of shift values in the full data set in figure 2 below). Thus, by testing for the largest value first, the query will be much less prone to get stuck in false leads. (Well, looking at the histogram, it appears that one could in fact do even better sorting than just from larger to smaller, like testing for values around 100 before values around 130 etc.)\n\nFigure 2: Histogram of NMR Shift values in 25000 spectrum datasetFigure 2: Histogram of NMR Shift values in 25000 spectrum dataset\n\n(Find the new Prolog code below. The SPARQL query, and earlier Prolog code, can be found as attachments to this blog post.)\n\nAutomatically abbreviate authors first names in bibtex\n\nI had all my references (50+) with all author names spelled out, but was told to abbreviate first names to one letter (Indeed that looks better IMO too). I didn't want to do that manually, and found out that this can automatically be done by using the bibtex style \"abbrv\". So I set it in my latex document with\n\n\nGSoC Project accepted\n\nJust got to know that my proposed GSoC 2010 project: \"General RDF export/import in Semantic MediaWiki\" (as documented here), was accepted! That's some good news! :). Mentor will be Denny Vrandečić from the Semantic MediaWiki community.\n\nSurely the project is going to be a challenge but it is a highly motivating one so I'm much looking forward to it, to hopefully, together with my mentor and the community, to solve things, and to learn a lot.\n\nI posted a (slightly shortened) copy of the project proposal and my bio here.\n\nThe project will be continuously documented here on this blog, so keep an eye here if you are interested (Use the GSoC2010 tag to filter out relevant posts). Community discussion will likely happen at the SMW-Devel mailing list, and if you want to contact me directly, you can do that at samuel dot lampa at gmail dot com or skype samuel_lampa.\n\nMy current status/schedule is:\n\n  • This week: Very busy, finishing thesis report.\n  • Next 2 weeks (though starting a little this week): Get dev. environment up running (leaning towards Eclipse with PDT) and looking at code\n  • 12/5: Briefing with Denny\n  • Up until 9th: Very busy period with exams on 24/5 and 8/6.\n  • On 9th: Start coding! (So coding start will be a little delayed, but will make up for that no worries! :) (not to used to having spare time anyway))\n\n\nThis is a slightly shortened version of the full Proposal, iniially posted on my user page on MediaWiki.org, and then in final form on the GSoC app site.\n\nBrowse semantic data in parallell\n\nThe semantic web field has seemed quite void of successful general user interfaces to browse semantic data in an efficient way (SPARQL querying is not really for everybody and their aunt). An interesting approach is the Freebase Parallax which lets you continuously views sets of data all while you narrow down or extend your search criteria, thus \"browsing in parallell\". Seems to make a lot of sence in its simplicity.\n\n3rd Project Update (Integrating SWI-Prolog for Semantic Reasoning in Bioclipse)\n\nI just had my 3rd, and last project update presentation (before the final presenation on April 28th), presenting results from comparing the performance of the integrated SWI-Prolog against Jena and Pellet, for a spectrum similarity search query. Find the sldes below.\n\nOn larger datasets and more peaks in the query, Prolog is the fastest\n\nIn a previous performance test I compared a NMR Spectrum similarity search programmed in Prolog and run in SWI-Prolog integrated in Bioclipse, against a SPARQL Query doing the same task, run in Jena, and Pellet, also integrated in Bioclipse.\n\nIn that test Jena was the fastest, outperforming Prolog. The test had flaws though, as reported here with new tests added, though these new results were still not giving a clear winner.\n\nThis changed when I turned to larger datasets, testing on the range 2000-25000 spectra (where 25000 spectra corresponds to around a million RDF triples), instead of 10-100, which is a lot closer to the size of all spectra in NMRShiftDB (36419 searchable spectra as of March 29, 2010). I also used 16 instead fo 3 peak shift values in the search query. When testing with these changes, Prolog clearly took the lead.\n\n(Bioclipse scripts, including the SPARQL Query, and the Prolog code, attached. See below).\n\nThis time I also included tests with Jena using both the in-memory RDF Store, and the Jena TDB disk based one. Interesting is that Jena run against the TDB disk based store is about double as fast as against the in-memory store! (I had to exclude the combination Pellet/TDB store, as it didn't complete for more than an hour, after which I stopped the run.)\n\nTo be noted, in these tests I did also take more measures as to avoid memory and/or caching related bias. For example, I did not rerun tests shortly after each other in a loop, but restarted Bioclipse after each run. This kind of testing took a lot more time, and I have so far only had time to do three iterataions for each specific size of dataset. Error bars, indicating the standard deviation, are included though to give an idea of the variation among the three. Hopefully I will have time to complement with a few more runs per measure point.\n\nSee figures below for results. I've included one figure where Pellet is included, and one where it is skipped, in order to get a zoom in on the Jena/Prolog difference.\n\n\n...and, Pellet excluded:\n\n\nCorrection of flawed results: Close competition between Jena and Prolog\n\nUPDATE 29/3: See new results here\n\nI reported in a previous blog post (with a bit of surprise) that Jena clearly outperformed SWI-Prolog for a NMR Spectrum similarity search run inside Bioclipse. I have now realized that indeed these previous results were flawed for a number of reasons.",

        "text": "Try Windows Blue for yourself using VirtualBox\n\nWindows Blue, the next Windows release, leaked onto the internet at the weekend. It has some interesting new features and tweaks, but because it’s such an early and buggy build it wouldn’t be advisable to replace your existing OS with it. You could of course dual boot from it, but it’s just as easy to run it in a virtual environment where any crashes or issues won’t lead to you having to reboot your PC.\n\nFor this guide I’ll use Oracle VM VirtualBox because it’s a great free program and setting up Windows Blue is incredibly straightforward with it.\n\nTo start you’ll obviously need a copy of the leaked image file -- build 9364. It’s available on all the usual torrent sites, so just do a quick search. The file you want is 2.63GB in size. There’s only a 32-bit version available, but because we’ll be running it in a virtualized environment, it will run fine on 64-bit systems.\n\nLaunch VirtualBox and click New in the Manager. In the Create Virtual Machine dialog box enter \"Windows 8\" as the name of the OS. VirtualBox will fill in the rest of the details for you.\n\nNext set the Memory Size. Accepting the recommended memory amount will likely be fine. On the next screen choose to \"Create a virtual hard drive now\" and click Create. Accept VDI (VirtualBox Disk Image) as the hard drive file type.\n\nYou’ll now be asked if you want the new virtual hard drive to be dynamic (it will grow as required) or a fixed size. I always select the latter option. It takes a while to create a fixed size drive, but the operating system runs faster afterwards.\n\nType in a name for the new virtual drive and choose a size for it. Again, accepting the default will likely be fine. Click Create and VirtualBox will begin building the drive. It will probably take around 10 minutes or so to do this (maybe more if like me you choose to convert some large videos at the same time).\n\nThe \"Select start-up disk\" window will open. If you’ve burnt the downloaded ISO file to disc you can select your drive in the drop down menu (if it’s not already selected). If you just have the file residing on your hard disk, click the folder icon and navigate to it instead.\n\nOnce selected, click Start and Windows 8 (which is what the OS is referred to throughout) will start to load. The language screen will appear first. You’ll have to accept English (United States) as this is the only option in the leaked build. On the next screen, click the \"Install now\" button.\n\nChoose the \"Custom: Install windows only (advanced)\" option. It will show you the drive it’s going to be installed on. Click Next, and it will begin the installation process, rebooting when required. When that’s done, personalize the OS by picking a color and entering a PC name, and then choosing to use the express settings (which I do) or customizing things further.\n\nSet up a Microsoft Account if required, and then that’s it. Windows Blue will be up and running and you can begin trying it out for yourself.\n",

        "text": "Kochi, Nov 2 IANS | 1 year ago\n\nIn order to attract more tourists coming for medical care, the government needs to make the medical visa application online and simpler, experts at a health summit said here Saturday.\n\n\"The process of medical tourism visa is very elaborate in our country. The person can get a visa only for 12 months and with only three entries. So, as long as the government makes the process clearer and facilitates online application, medical tourism cannot grow well in the country,\" said Harish Pillai, chief executive officer, Aster Medcity.\n\n\"The formalities regulating the visa need to be made simpler and especially the rules related to the extension of visa need a lot of rethinking,\" said Sanjay Cherian, vice president of Frontier Lifeline Hospital.\n\nThe experts were speaking at the fourth edition of the Kerala Health Tourism meet which ended Saturday.\n\nApart from highlighting the medical visa problem, the experts also spoke about the need for easing health insurance business in India.\n\n\"Currently only 15 percent of the population have medical insurance in the country. As the middle class rises in the country, there is an urgent need to increase the scope for health insurance, for which the government needs to ease the insurance business,\" said Hoosh Mires, operations director of Freedom Healthnet, an insurance company.\n\nThough, the market for medical tourism is expected to grow annually at 30 percent to reach USD 1.55 billion by 2015, however, it is much lower compared to countries like Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia and Taiwan which receive more tourists and earn larger revenue from medical tourism.\n\n\"The need for India at present is to engage in elaborate marketing...,\" said Charles Stanford, senior director, LLH hospital Dubai.\n\nThough India has good expertise, low cost and lesser waiting period, there is a need to develop the infrastructure, improve hygiene and standarisation of the accreditation process so that tourists' trust could be gained.\n\n(Posted on 02-11-2013)",

        "text": "Tasty Thursday: Quinoa Stuffed Peppers\n\nThis recipe is one of my go to recipes when I want something hearty and healthy for dinner.  I do not eat a lot of red meat, but sometimes it really hits the spot.\n\nQuinoa stuffed peppers is by far my favorite ground beef recipe (other than tacos…maybe).  The original Quinoa stuffed pepper recipe I found was actually a vegetarian recipe.  I must have been craving red meat the night I made it because I added the ground beef and never looked back.  To this day, I have not tried the original recipe.\n\n\nQuinoa Stuffed Peppers\n\nServing: 4 large peppers\n\n\n  • 4 large peppers\n  • 1 1b. of lean ground beef\n  • 1 onion\n  • 2 garlic cloves\n  • 1 c. of Quinoa\n  • 2 c. of water\n  • 1- 28 oz. can of diced tomatoes\n  • 1- 12 oz. jar of salsa\n  • cheddar cheese\n\n\nPre-heat the oven to 325.  Bring 1 cup of Quinoa and 2 cups of water to a boil, cook Quinoa for approximately 15 minutes.  Steam 4 large peppers until they are soft, but not limp.  In a large skillet, brown the ground beef.  Once it has browned add chopped onion, garlic, diced tomatoes (reserve the juice) and salsa.  Cook over medium heat for 10 minutes.  Fold in Quinoa.  Next, place the peppers in a baking dish and fill with Quinoa mixture.  Top with cheddar cheese and bake for 30-35 minutes.\n\n\n*To make this dish vegetarian, simply replace the ground beef with 1/2 lb. of mushrooms or veggies of your choice. \n\nThis week, I am linking to 33 Shades of Green: Tasty Tuesday\n\n\n\n\n  1. says\n\n    These sound (and look) delicious!! I’ve never made stuffed peppers before, but I love quinoa. I think I’ll make these this weekend! But I have a silly question…how do you steam whole peppers?!!!\n\n    • says\n\n      I love quionoa, and this recipe looks great!\n      If you cook more quinoa than need, it also look great in a salad with tomato yellow corn grains and onions.\n\n    • Deborah Carroll says\n\n      I always turn it down to simmer. It may still be under done but cooking it in the oven finishes it off.\n\n  2. says\n\n    Oh my *quinoa* heaven…this looks amazing!!! It’s been a long time since I’ve made stuffed peppers of any kind, so I’m thinkin’ this is going on the menu this week (c;\n\n  3. Deborah Carroll says\n\n    I like to use ground turkey and swiss cheese as well. You can substitute chicken broth for the water when cooking the Quinoa to give it a bit more flavor as well.",

        "text": "Thursday, January 18, 2018\n\nScream Time\n\nFor the longest time, we did an excellent job minimizing our kids' screen time. Then the grandparents came and fucked it up.\n\nUntil this fall, our kids basically had the privilege of a movie on Sundays. If they really did not behave well during the weekend, we would take it away. It was a nice chance for us to get stuff done and/or get a break for about 90 minutes. We've been having these \"Sunday afternoon movies\" for years. We started with the 90 minute Disney/Pixar films we owned, and then transitioned to 3-4 episodes of shows they liked on Netflix. \n\nA couple of years ago we first got an iPad, and we then started occasionally letting them have 15-20 minutes of games on the weekend. More recently I had tied the iPad time to chores. When they put their laundry away, they could have the iPad. They had to take turns, and when the timer went off, the time was up, no negotiations. \n\nSure they asked for more. They were always asking for our phones, tried to wheedle us into more iPad time or to have a movie on Saturday AND Sunday, or to watch one more show. But the rules were set. There was never TV or games on weekdays and they never even asked.\n\nWe don't have a television set, and movies/shows. are generally watched in the basement on our screen, or on a laptop or iPad upstairs. \n\nThen my parents bought the boys Kindle Fires. They bought them a couple years ago for my sister's kids but I told them we didn't want them. Then B & L realized that their cousins had them, and started their attack on grandma and grandpa. Finally I relented.  Now they got 1 hour of kindle time on each weekend day when/if they finished chores and nothing else was planned. They could play games, read books, or listen to music.\n\nIn preparation for our trip, I changed the settings to allow them to access videos to download for the flight. And I turned off the time restrictions. And for 3 weeks they basically had unlimited screen time every single day. Even when they went back to school, MIL gave them the kindles as soon as they came home & finished homework and they played until we got home and made them put it away. On the 2 snow days, they  probably were on those damn things for 13 hours straight. \n\nAdditionally, since our basement is being fixed, we had the laptop set up hooked up to speakers in the living room and MIL would frequently watch her shows on it when the kids were awake so they would crowd around to watch, and then demand their own shows which she always gave in to. \n\nI took the Kindles away on Monday and told them they were not getting them back until January, and then only if they showed some improvement in behavior between now and then. I also made G put the speakers and laptop away.\n\nI don't in any way think the screen time caused the bad behavior, because it started well before. But I do know that it is impossible to connect with them when they are absorbed in their screens, and I am coming around to the \"Peaceful Parenting\" mantra that connection is necessary for teaching and modeling good behavior and values. \n\nOf course, it goes both ways. I have my own obsession with my Kindle (or more accurately, the app on my phone) and I know that putting my phone and books away is also part of this solution. I know my kids behave better when I give them my full attention. Its just a vicious cycle---they act badly, I retreat to my phone, they act worse...Then I lose my shit and let them watch a show so that I can have a break. \n\nScreen time was our biggest bribing tactic...but it also didn't really work. I just kept giving them second and third chances to \"earn\" the time back because I needed them glued to their screens so I didn't have to deal with their behavior and wants and needs for a while. \n\nWe may still do family movie night on Friday, because I think sitting together and watching the same thing is a whole different situation then each kid watching their own thing on their own device, and even the two kids watching together and G and I using the time to talk is somewhat better. \n\nThe rest of the weekend will be challenging. We have no set plans and its winter. I know they will ask a million times, and I will have to say \"no\" each time. We will have to be engaged and creative in keeping them occupied. I am going to make G sit down to plan the weekend at least loosely tonight so that we don't lose our shit and cave. Library, indoor swimming, baking something, board games, books, legos. We will have to find a way to get through the days...and thankfully there is always wine.\n\nWednesday, January 17, 2018\n\nThose Kids\n\nYou know the ones. The ones you see and wonder \"where are the parents? Why can't they control their kids? Aren't they too old to be acting like that?\"\n\nYou guys. My kids? They are assholes. I sort of suspected it for a few months but during our trip when we really spent all day every day with them, we saw it quite clearly. They are rude, disrespectful, don't follow directions or listen to us, are not appreciative, and whine constantly. I am embarrassed at their behavior when we are out in public, and mortified at the way they treat others.\n\nFor B, I am fairly certain that he just does not consider other's feelings. He is very rigid and black and white in his thinking and everything that isn't exactly what he wants at that particular moment is bad and awful and he will say so, loudly and inventively. He also cannot pick up on the fact that he has hurt someone's feelings or is being annoying. We have to be very concrete and explicit with him about cause and effect of his words and actions.\n\nI don't know what L's problem is, though. He is very impulsive and loves to push boundaries and buttons. The more we tell him not to do something he will do it. This includes calling my MIL an idiot to her face, hitting us, screaming at the top of his lungs. He is extremely sensitive and KNOWS he is hurting our feelings or being annoying, and then feels shame about it, which drives him to act even worse. It is very  hard to break the cycle and requires more patience then any of us usually have, but eventually, he will break down in tears and let you hug him, and be cheerful again.\n\nThe worst part was having their awfulness confirmed by MIL who previously acted like they were perfect angels. She lost HER SHIT with them more than a few times, and I could feel the silent judging of our parenting choices. In a culture where respect to elders is taught and valued highly, I cannot get over my shame and mortification at the way they would sometimes talk to her. That she takes EVERYTHING so damn personally doesn't help, but honestly, as much as I have many many issues with that woman, I agree with her that \"we have to train them better\".\n\nAs usual, after a period of being depressed and despondent and needing to check out a bit, I am now being proactive and optimistic about how to change things. We are back to social skills therapy after a month off for holidays/snow and have made a plan to reinforce the weekly lessons at home. G and I have talked about how we need to \"coach\" B to behave in socially acceptable ways, rather than scolding and admonishing, we need to model and work through how to talk to others, how to respond to questions, how to effectively voice complaints and dissents.\n\nTo combat B's constant negativity, we are all listing \"3 good things\" before bed each day. I am looking into a meditation for kids that we can also do before bed. I payed for Headspace so I can explore all the options. I have taken away screen time indefinitely. We had a long talk about kindness and how much we value that in our family and that we are ALL going to work on that this year. That means no yelling and rough handling on our end, too.  My plan is to have check in \"meetings\" about how things are going every weekend.\n\nI know that checking out and trying to ignore and pretend it isn't happening only makes me feel better in the moment. I need to put away my phone or my book or whatever is swirling through my mind and really be present for the boys. With no screen time and no end of winter in sight, we will have to fill our weekends creatively. I also want to plan for one on one time with each kid weekly.\n\nIts a lot, but I know we need to do it. I am certain there are still two sweet and loving kids in there, we need to bring them back out.\n\nTuesday, January 16, 2018\n\nWind My Spring\n\nI did finish Strange & Norrell (meh. skip it. boring meandering inconsistent plot and terrible characterization) and wound up starting and finishing Norwegian Wood (Murakami) on SHU's recommendation. It was so sad but beautiful. I loved it and keep thinking about parts of it. The protagonist is going through some inner turmoil but is trying to live his life and metaphorically talks about how most mornings he gets up and winds his spring so that he can get through everything he has to do until the day is done and he can sleep. On Sundays he gets a break and doesn't wind the spring.\n\nI realized as I sat in the living room yesterday afternoon, sipping wine and reading those words that I didn't wind my spring. Read those words again: sat, afternoon, wine, reading. I wasn't doing chores, or being present with my family (they were all upstairs playing legos). I wasn't fitting in another workout or decluttering or any number of things that probably needed to get done. I just...sat. And read.\n\nMost mornings, even especially weekends, I spend a few minutes psyching myself up for the day ahead. I think through the sequence of events I need to get through and the items on the list I have to check off. I also remind myself of all the things I shouldn't be doing: no wine, no snacks, no phone in the evenings... It takes many turns of the spring to make sure I'll keep moving all day.\n\nMaybe because it was the third day of a loooonnnggg weekend spent in the house with whiny kids (more on that in another post) and I was limp with relief that MIL had just left. I dunno. I just needed to not be doing anything purposeful for an hour or two.\n\nThen I got up and did laundry and made dinner and lunches and went to bed on time and woke up early this morning to go to the gym, then PT, then work and...yeah. Spring-winding time is back.\n\nThursday, January 11, 2018\n\nSnails pace\n\nThis week! My god! Why so slow?! Maybe because its the first 5 day week in a while AND I'm on call AND my MIL is here AND AND AND\n\nGood things that have happened:\n  • 3 workouts, including my first day back to my beloved dark-o-clock 30 minute HIIT class. I was so deliciously sore the next day! I'm planning my foray back into bodypump strength training tomorrow AM and trying some new classes our gym is offering this weekend\n  • I'm at 80% of Strange & Norrell. Its gotten more interesting, but not sure its going to pay off in the end. I'm hoping to finish before the weekend.\n  • Booked flights (literally 5 minutes ago) for our extended family (my parents, sister & her family) major-theme-park trip next month. I'm not sure if I'm excited or dreading this, TBH. Not sure when we will tell the kids. I want them to get used to school mode for a few weeks.\n  • I have also been doing my back PT, and found a perfect incentive. One episode of a favorite podcast at 1.3 speed perfectly covers the time. I listed to BoBW and Happier so far this week.\n  • Not really a \"thing that happened\" but I wanted to share the BEST JEANS EVER. I literally have worn them maybe 75% of all the days in the past 6 weeks since I got them. On the plane, all day through Legoland, work, around the house. They are the only stretchy jeans I have every tried that do not get baggy or need to be pulled up. Even the designer ones that cost twice as much (on major sale) are not as amazing as these. I need to get a pair in blue and maybe a back-up pair of black. I told G that \"all my other pants are garbage\" compared to these and I am not exaggerating.\nOK, my break is over. Back to work.\n\nTuesday, January 9, 2018\n\nIs it really only Tuesday?\n\nIts a call week and I can't believe its only 2/5 over! Thankfully I am NOT on this weekend.\n\nI feel bad complaining but I am kind of also over the disruptions in our schedules having MIL around. On the one hand, yes its AMAZING that we didn't have to blink at the snow days and early closures but on the other hand, its really hard to get the kids back into the groove of a regular schedule when she is still spoiling them constantly with treats & screens. We need to reinstate some consistency and discipline dammit!\n\nI'm doing pretty well with my healthy habits. I went to a 6:15 AM gym class, meditated, drank 2 L of water, and ate vegetables, salad, and veggie soup (plus the \"fun\" part of my lunch, 1 oz of cheddar with 6 water crackers).\n\nWhat else? I'm reading a very long book. \"Jonathon Strange & Mr. Norrell\". Its...weird. Not sure how I feel about it yet, though I'm 50% through. Its good enough to keep going at least. I have to read \"The Year of Yes\" for book club which seems like it'll be quick & fluffy, and I have the audiobook of \"Little Fires Everywhere\" to get through in the next couple of weeks, too.\n\nOur dishwasher, which is just over a year old (and thus, just out of warranty) has started not draining consistently and making a smoking/burning smell.  Argh. We are in the middle of more basement waterproofing/fixing (the waterproofing is done but now we are getting the drywall and floors put back and painting, etc..) and we just don't have the time, energy, money for ANOTHER home repair fiasco at the moment.\n\nIt was warmer during the day today so hopefully I won't be ice skating home this evening. I saw SO MANY people totally wipe out yesterday and this morning (including my kids). Walk slowly with your feet directly under your body if its icy!!\n\nMonday, January 8, 2018\n\nBack to myself!\n\nWhoa, I was in a funk last week! I guess the single digit temps & lack of sunlight on top of the letdown of something you've planned and looked forward to for 6 months finally being over really did a number on my mood. Add in some extra work stress and it was a recipe for a major bout of the blues.\n\nOn Saturday I was feeling happy and making plans again. Some extra sunshine and some talk about upcoming trips and spring activities for the kids, or just time, good sleep, good food, and some much-needed mindfulness and journaling may have helped.\n\nI had a really good weekend. Friday we did pizza and family movie (Cars 3...not terrible). Saturday I was up bright and early to see patients in clinic (we have to do a few Saturday clinics per year). All my patients showed and I saw them, wrote my notes, and spent a couple hours revamping my grant ideas. I then crossed some tasks of my list: went to Indian store & put away Christmas decorations, laundry, and made a half batch of toffee chocolate chip cookies (G, the boys, and MIL were at the science museum all this time). When everyone got home we watched another movie together (its the thing to do when its freezing outside, I guess) and G and I braved the cold for a date night dinner & had yummy Korean food, including a truly sizzling hot pot that warmed us from the inside out (cocktails helped, too).\n\nSunday I went to barre and grocery shopping, and baked the chocolate chip banana bread my MIL loves (I don't eat bananas, but apparently its good). We prepped food & made lunches for the week and then G and I went on a day date! (taking good advantage of having MIL around!). We were going to watch Lady Bird but by the time we stood in the loooong (outside!) line, the movie had already started and the only seats were right up front So we stood in the long outside line AGAIN to get refunds and went to the bar across the street for cocktails and snacks before we headed back home to usual Sunday evening chores, dinner, and kids bedtime.\n\nI'm really feeling encouraged about my back. Though the MRI did confirm herniation and some impingement (which explains my symptoms perfectly), I'm not having that much back pain and rarely do I have the radicular pain down my left leg. I have moved on from pain relief to strengthening the muscles around my back in PT FINALLY (I spent September-December in the same cycle of every single thing we tried making the pain worse and spending the entire session undoing that). I was also given the green light to try various exercise regimens again and see how I feel, with the plan to immediately stop and avoid anything that caused the leg pain. \n\nI have decided to focus more on habits and baby steps this quarter than on any big overarching goals. I plan to spend this cold cold winter in \"Hygge\" mode. I know its the trendy thing, but it struck a chord for a reason, its a really nice way to rethink winter. For me that means: movies/board games/books with the kids, baking and soups, cozy socks and sweaters, and keeping the Christmas lights up outside to brighten our homecoming until the evenings get lighter. I also want to make sure I get outside every single day in the sunshine. I get so blah when I stay home or stuck in my dim office so I'm making an effort to avoid that.\n\nThe habits I'm working are all related to physical and mental health. Specific habits I am tracking: meditation (I splurged on a Headspace subscription and I'm reworking through the intro), drinking enough water, doing my PT exercises every other day, working out 4 X a week, no after dinner snacking, and gratitude (writing \"3 good things\" in my journal at the end of each day).\n\nI also deleted FB and IG from my phone, whoo hoo!\n\nWednesday, January 3, 2018\n\nAnother year, another word\n\nI'm actually having trouble mustering up enthusiasm for goal-setting and planning for the new year. I listened to the Happier podcast about \"18 for 2018\" and sat down two separate times to try to come up with a list of 18 things I wanted to do this year and I just...couldn't. Everything I keep thinking of is boring and incremental, or I've already resolved to do it year after year and failed to keep it up.\n\nI can't even think of any quarterly or seasonal goals right now. Nothing that is inspiring or new or fun. So I figured I'd at least think of my \"one word\" for the year. And I did! And then I changed it...about 4 times. I'll bring you along on my navel-gazing journey.\n\nMy initial word was \"Presence\" as a reminder to focus on mindfulness and being fully immersed in whatever I am doing at any given moment, and a reminder to recommit to mediation and limiting technology use. I know I am a better parent when I do this,  and obviously much more productive at work. But it seemed so cliche and almost too high-minded for how I am feeling these days.\n\nThe latter half of 2017 kind of, well, sucked. I feel like I'm spinning my wheels and stagnating professionally and personally. For the first time in a LONG time I cannot find my usual levels of optimism. I really need to get unstuck in my career and we also need to break out of some negative habits and routines as a family and shake things up because ugh. I've made little/backwards progress on my fitness, spending, etc...\n\nSo I picked the word \"Forward\" because that's where I want to be by 2019---at least one step closer to...something better. But, you know, sometimes things aren't completely under your control and the belief that you can always attain what you want just by working hard and wanting it sounds naive to me right now and the constant push to do MORE and be BETTER is exhausting. .Maybe I need to just be OK with my life as it is.\n\n\"Acceptance\" seems like a good intention for anytime, right? Change what you can and accept the rest? But am I changing all that I can? Things have been pretty much status quo for years now. Maybe the right move isn't just continuing to trudge down the same old worn path, through ever increasing obstacles when you don't even know if you want to go where that road is taking you.\n\nThese are big and scary thoughts for me to even consider. This is going to take some unpacking and sorting out. I'm terrified of change. I do everything in my power to avoid thinking about it.But its time. So I'm vowing to be \"OPEN\" in 2018. Open to what-ifs, and maybes, and entertaining options. To having conversations about possibilities. Maybe there will be decisions, maybe not. That's not really the point.",

For this purpose, ITC (2010) guidelines were followed in translating the scale (forward & backward translations) and the resultant scale after pilot testing was validated by the administration on 597 working adults, including 391 males and 206 females belonging to three cities, Karachi, Multan and Lahore.\n\nTranslation and Adaptation of Subjective Job Stress Scale into Urdu\nTranslation and Adaptation of Subjective Job Stress Scale into Urdu\nOut of the total respondents, 50 were later reached for test-retest reliability. For validation and determination of psychometric properties, different measures of Reliability & Validity Analysis were carried out. The latter was carried out by assessing Cronbach’s Alpha coefficient (.82), Split-half (Gutman) coefficient (.86), and Test-retest reliability (.70). For validity analysis scores on SJSS translation were correlated with scores of Perceived Stress Scale, (r =.86, p<.01), Rosenberg’s Self-Esteem scale (r = -.72, p<.01), and Job Satisfaction Survey (r = -.69, p<.01), which proved adequate convergent validity. Hence the instrument was found to be an adequate measure of Job Stress to be used with local Pakistani workforce.\n\n\nAuthors of the Article\n\n  •  Khalida Rauf\n    Asim Farooq\n\nAvail Article [sociallocker id=64051]\n\n\nNeed Any Other Article:\n\nAre you looking for any other article?

        "text": "MONTREAL—Yves Themens swore he wasn’t a corrupt civil servant during his testimony at the Charbonneau Commission on Wednesday.\n\nHe accepted bottles of wine, hockey ticket, and golf trips from contractors—but he says he would have been useless to any contractor looking for a favor.\n\n\"In my job, there was no way for me to either help someone get a contract or modify costs, or bring any special advantages over someone else. My job was strictly an administrative one,\" said Themens.\n\nThe engineer has been suspended by the City of Montreal due to allegations of corruption within his department.\n\nDespite his administrative posting, Themens never raised any red flags about skyrocketing costs for contracts he was supposed to approve, or that a closed circle of contractors won all bids.\n\n“It's not like we could provide solutions,” Themens said in his defence.\n\nThe senior engineer also said that it was not his job to review contracts and cost overruns, but simply to ensure that the amount paid on contracts matched the amount budgeted.\n\nLawyers asked him many questions about phone calls at all hours of the day, night, and weekends that he received from construction companies. Themens said everything discussed in those calls was on the up and up.\n\nWhen Themens took a trip to Cuba with self-confessed corrupt colleagues Gilles Surprenant and Luc Leclerc, he insisted he paid his own way and didn't talk corruption. That testimony contradicted that of his former colleagues.\n\n\nThemens also disputed previous testimony offered Surprenant when he said that he saw his boss, Themens, flashing $100-bills and boasting that he had received his cut from 'Tony.' That revelation led to Themens's immediate suspension at work.\n\nThemens said that event never happened and that he wasn't Surprenant's boss either.\n\nLooking at an organizational chart of how the engineering department was organized, Themens said that nobody reported to him, and identified two other men as being Surprenant's direct superiors.\n\nNo matter how often Themens said he didn't receive any bribes, it was obvious Judge Charbonneau refused to believe him. As a supervisor, Themens should have known something was wrong she said.\n\n“It totally went over your head? You signed without asking questions?” asked Charbonneau.\n\n“It didn't go over my head, if I saw exaggerated costs, I asked questions,” Themens responded.\n\nThe judge was so suspicious she asked Themens to submit his stamped passport and cancelled cheques to prove he paid his own trip to Cuba; Themens nervously agreed.\n\nThe day ended with the questioning of a new witness, Michel Paquette, who confirmed the constant gifts of wine and diners. He will continue his testimony on Thursday.",

        "text": "Army of Italy (France)\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\nJump to navigation Jump to search\nGeneral Napoleon Bonaparte, commander of the Armée d'Italie on the bridge at Arcole\n\nThe Army of Italy (French: Armée d'Italie) was a field army of the French Army stationed on the Italian border and used for operations in Italy itself. Though it existed in some form in the 16th century through to the present, it is best known for its role during the French Revolutionary Wars (in which it was one of the early commands of Napoleon Bonaparte, during his Italian campaign) and Napoleonic Wars.\n\n\nFrench Army entering Rome in 1798\n\nBonaparte's reforms[edit]\n\nPoorly supplied (uniforms and shoes were rare), and only getting reinforcements irregularly, the Army of Italy was sometimes reduced to looting to survive. When Bonaparte arrived (he took up command on 27 March 1796), indiscipline was rife. Chouan songs were sung by the troops, and a company of the Dauphin was formed. All the while improving the supply system as much as possible, Bonaparte also reestablished discipline. He condemned officers who had cried Vive le roi !, (English: \"Live the king!\"), dismissed the 13th regiment of hussards for indiscipline and dissolved an entire regiment when it revolted at the end of March. Purged in this way, the Army of Italy was subsequently the most Jacobin of all the French armies.\n\nIts first victories improved things - allowing better resupply and easing pay problems through \"war contributions\" from the conquered lands - but memoirs (though not official communiques) speak of individual or collective failures right up to 1797.\n\nReserve army[edit]\n\nMuch of the original Armée d'Italie became the Army of Egypt. Another army, originally called the armée de Réserve, was formed at Dijon on 8 March 1800 (17 ventôse year VIII) and took the title Armée d'Italie on 23 June 1800 (4 messidor year VIII) when it was merged with the remains of the original Armée d'Italie. The new army's first commander was Masséna, followed by Bonaparte (as First Consul and \"Commander in person\") and général Berthier (its 'Général en chef' from 2 April to 23 June 1800)[1] It was under Berthier that this army beat the Austrians at the Battle of Marengo on 14 June 1800 (25 prairial year 8).[2]\n\n\n  • from 7 November to 25 December 1792: General d'Anselme, with neither the title nor the prerogative of a general\n  • from 26 December 1792 to 9 February 1793, interim: maréchal de camp Brunet\n  • from 10 February to 4 May 1793: General Biron\n  • from 5 May to 8 August 1793: General Brunet ; from 2 June subordinate to General Kellermann\n  • from 9 August 1793 to 20 November 1794: General du Merbion\n  • Army before Toulon (Armée devant Toulon):\n    • from 5 September to 6 November 1793: General Carteaux\n    • from 7 to 12 November, interim: General La Poype\n    • from 13 to 15 November, provisionally until the arrival of General Dugommier: General Doppet\n    • from 16 November to 28 December: General Dugommier with the title of General and commander of the Army of Italy (général en chef de armée d'Italie)\n  • from 21 November 1794 to 5 May 1795: General Schérer\n  • from 6 May to 28 September 1795: General Kellermann,[α] commanded the merged Army of Italy and Army of the Alps (armée des Alpes), with the designation of the Army of Italy\n  • from 29 September 1795 to 26 March 1796: General Schérer, resigned\n  • from 27 March 1796 to 16 November 1797: General Bonaparte\n  • from 17 November to 21 December 1797, interim: General Kilmaine\n  • from 22 December 1797 to 3 April 1798: General Berthier\n  • from 4 April to 27 July 1798: General Brune\n  • from 28 July to 18 August 1798, interim: General Gaultier\n  • from 19 August to 31 October 1798: General Brune\n  • from 1 November 1798 to 31 January 1799: General Joubert, as part of the overall command of the Army of Rome (armée de Rome). From 11 to 25 December, the army's commander was effectively General Moreau.\n  • from 1 February to 6 March: General Delmas\n  • from 7 to 11 March 1799, provisional: General Bruneteto Sainte-Suzanne\n  • from 12 March to 26 April 1799: General Schérer, as part of his overall command of the Army of Naples (armée de Naples)\n  • from 27 April to 4 August 1799: General Moreau, as part of his overall command of the Army of Naples\n  • from 5 to 15 August 1799: General Joubert, commander of both the Army of Italy and the Army of the Alps, killed at the battle of Novi\n  • from 15 August to 20 September 1799: General Moreau\n  • from 21 September to 30 December 1799: General Championnet\n  • from 31 December 1799 to 5 January 1800: General Suchet[α]\n  • from 6 to 15 January 1800, interim: General Marbot\n  • from 16 January to 16 June 1800: General Masséna[α]\n  • from 17 to 24 June 1800, interim: General Suchet\n  • from 25 June to 21 August 1800: General Masséna\n  • from 22 August 1800 to 7 March 1801: General Brune[α]\n  • from 8 March to 27 August 1801, interim: General Moncey[α]\n  1. ^ a b c d e Made a Marshal of the Empire (maréchal d’Empire) or was in the staff of one.\n\nCampaigns and battles[edit]\n\n\nArmée d'Italie participated in the war of the Third Coalition (1805), in the battles of Verona and Caldiero in northern Italy, under André Massena. During the war of the Fifth Coalition (1809), Armée d'Italie was commanded by Eugène de Beauharnais, and fought the austrians at Sacile, Caldiero, Piave, and Raab. In 1813-1814 Eugéne fought the austrians with his army in northern Italy. (Battle of Mincio)[4]\n\n\n  1. ^ \"The consular magistracy was essentially civil, the principal of the division of powers and of ministers' responsibilities made it undesirable that the first magistrate of the Republic should be immediately in command of an Armée; but no disposition, just as no principle, would oppose that which was present ... As it turned out, the First Consul commanded the armée de réserve, and Berthier, his major général, took the title général en chef.\" : Memoirs of Napoléon, volume VI, page 196\n  2. ^ Alexandre Berthier, Relation de la bataille de Marengo ...; Paris 1805. // Le Capitaine de Cugnac, Campagne de l’armée de Réserve en 1800; Paris 1900\n  3. ^ NAPOLEON'S ITALIAN CAMPAIGN 1805-1815.

The gardens are owned by Rosemary Howell who is ably assisted by her son, John and his wife Lorna.\n\nThe weather was perfect with partial sun and clear skies and the beautiful colours of the Camellias, Rhododendrons, Azaleas, Magnolias and a wealth of internationally sourced trees made it a truly unforgettable experience.\n\nThe Lukesland Estate consists of a total of 24 acres and rather amazingly the gardens are maintained by members of the Howell Family and only two part-time gardeners.\n\nDue to spasmodic flooding from the Addicombe Brook which flows through the Estate in a North/South direction there has been a certain amount of remodelling in the garden where we thoroughly enjoyed seeing the Brook cascading over various waterfalls and filling ornamental pools before eventually joining the River Erme.\n\nAt the end of the afternoon we all congregated in the “Old Billiard Room” for a very welcome cup of tea and a slice of homemade cake. Everyone agreed it had been a very special visit and is without doubt one of Dartmoor’s best kept secrets.\n\nBack to top\n\nDartmoor Society AGM 2017\n\nDartmoor Society Award 2017\n\nDartmoor Society AGM 2017\n\nPosted in Events on Monday 8th May 2017 at 9:58pm\n\nOn the afternoon of Saturday the 22nd April 2017, 30 Dartmoor Society members congregated at Yelverton Memorial Hall for the 19th Annual General Meeting.\n\nBefore the business proceedings, Tom Stratton, Deputy Land Steward, Western District, Duchy of Cornwall presented on “Managing the Duchy of Cornwall Estate on Dartmoor”.\n\nAt the close of the AGM business the Annual Dartmoor Society Award 2017 was presented to John Tuffnell, Treasurer of Kelly Mine Preservation Society based near Lustleigh. The mine closed in 1951, however since 1984 a small group of dedicated volunteers have worked tirelessly, year in year out, to carefully conserve, maintain and restore it to its present day first class condition, ensuring that it is now one of the finest examples of preserved rural industry of its kind in the country.\n\nAt the end of the afternoon we all tucked into a delicious tea prepared by the Executive Committee giving everyone a chance to eat, drink and socialise.\n\nBack to top\n",

        "text": "So, while working on my blog for this week (which I’m still writing) I tidied up my office area and found out that I have five duplicate books! Because I love sharing and enjoy helping new fundraisers or those without many resources, I’ll give send along one of these books to a fundraiser who makes a good pitch as to why they need one! Make your case in the comments.\n\n\nThankYouEconomyCoverThe Thank You Economy by Gary Vaynerchuk\n\nI just love this book and wrote a review (I haven’t reviewed every fundraising book I’ve read, unfortunately). I think this is a great book to fully understand why customer service and thanking is so critical, and draws important ideas from the old economy to how social media works to enhance customor service. I often suggest that people have someone from the C-Suite read this to better understand the great role that social media can play in connecting with customers and supporters.\n\n\n\nBook3D3D Philanthropy by Fraser Green\n\nExcellent read to learn more about how your donors thinking about giving are engaging more than their heads and hearts… they are engaging their souls. Fraser writes with lots of examples of how donors think and are motivated and how it is more than “just a feeling” but how and how a donor thinks with their values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGiving 2.0: Transform Your Giving and Our World by Laura Arrillaga-Andreessen\n\nI enjoyed this book but I found it wasn’t so much for the experienced fundraising practitioner but rather how we think about philanthropy and new ways to engage in giving and supporting.\n\n\n\n\n\nI pretty much enjoy all the books I’ve ready by Jerry. Great advice, written to be easy to understand for the non-professional fundraiser, board member or volunteer. The books starts with the joy of asking and moves to the details of an ask.\n\n\n\n\nBookFired-upFired-Up Fundraising: Turn Board Passion into Action by Gail Perry\n\nGail is super smart about engaging major donors (I guess that is how I got two of them!) and if you are working in this area of fundraising or wish to move into it, this is a great book. Stuffed full of great info. She really knows how to engage board members to help YOU and help your nonprofit.\n\n\n\nTo get one of these books sent to you, simply state your case in the comments or if you have a colleague/friend in a nonprofit you think should read it, submit on his or her behalf. I’ll close the comments (for the give away) on April 29, 2014. I’ll pick the winner that night. I’ll contact the winner to get the best address. Wherever you live or work, the US, Canada or elsewhere, I’ll send it!\n\nYes! I want joy sailing through my inbox!\n\n\n  • Accomplish anything with grit, grace + gratitude.\n  • Navigate a successful career + balance your personal life.\n  • Create deeper relationships between supporters + your nonprofit.\n  • Understand how to work with high net-worth supporters.\n\n\nPin It on Pinterest",

If the guys bringing the food, ammo and fuel can’t keep up, it doesn’t take long before bad things happen.\n\nThere is a similar analogy with the stock market. One has to ask how much longer can the Dow and the S&P 500 continue to outrun the rest of the market? There is an old story about a potentially ominous situation when the blue chip stocks continue to make new highs while the rest of the market has possibly topped out or is in some degree of correction.\n\nThe story suggests that when the generals leading the advance up the hill eventually look over their shoulders and see the troops in full retreat, they soon have to join the retreat.\n\nAt the risk of being the skunk at the party, I have to ask how much longer can the blue chips (the generals) pretend that everything remains positive for the economy and supportive of higher stock prices when the broad market (the soldiers) and the transportation index (the supply guys) are not?\n\nDoes it matter that new home sales fell 4.6 percent in February — the biggest decline in two years? Or that durable goods orders without aircraft orders fell 2.7 percent in February? Or that consumer confidence fell from 68.0 to 59.7 in March? Or that consumer sentiment plunged from 79.3 to 72.3 in April (a nine-month low\n\nHave you noticed in the past few months a divergence between a rising stock market and declining commodity prices? This is a potentially ominous sign for the economy and stock market going forward. A six-year chart of the CRB Index of Commodity Prices shows declining commodity prices usually indicate demand for goods is dropping and the economy is in trouble.\n\nText Only\nLocal News\n  • Take a 'National Night Out'\n\n\n    July 31, 2014\n\n  • Well affected by mercury spill is working again\n\n\n    July 31, 2014\n\n  • Roosevelt building Big plans in the works for Roosevelt\n\n\n    July 31, 2014 1 Photo\n\n\n    July 31, 2014 1 Photo\n\n  • Clinton judge hears motion to suppress in drug case\n\n\n    July 30, 2014\n\n\n\n    July 30, 2014 1 Photo\n\n\n\n    July 29, 2014 1 Photo\n\n  • New sentencing hearing sought in robbery case\n\n    A man serving a minimum of seven years in prison on a second-degree robbery charge has applied for a new sentencing hearing, seeking a prison sentence without a mandatory minimum.\n\n    July 29, 2014\n\n\n\n    July 28, 2014 1 Photo\n\n  • Judge rejects McClellan's suspended sentence\n\n    A Clinton man accused of assaulting his girlfriend recanted his guilty plea after a District Court judge rejected a plea agreement that recommended a suspended sentence.\n\n    July 28, 2014\n\nClinton Herald photos\n\nBrowse, buy and submit pictures with our photo site.",

        "text": "Nikki Cox Looks Ridiculous\n\n\nYou know how some people wear their heart on their sleeve? Well apparently actress Nikki Cox has decided to wear her labia on her face…\n\nNikki Cox before & after collagen injections:\n\nnikki cox lip injections plastic surgery\n\nIt looks like Nikki got her lips over stuffed with some injectable filler and she looks absolutely ridiculous. Not only do her lips now resemble female genitalia, but the HUGE lips throw off the proportions of her other features. In comparison to her new supersized lips, her eyes look tiny and squinty. It’s a shame, she used to be strikingly beautiful.\n\n Tags: , , , ,\n\n\n  • avatar elaine says:\n\n    I totally noticed her lips when that Las Vegas show was still on Friday nights. I was like WTF?!?!\n\n  • avatar Anna says:\n\n    She never looked “strikingly beautiful” but now she looks like a sad, sad victim of a mental disease.\n\n  • avatar pak31 says:\n\n    What is wrong with this girl? She already had full lips. I just can’t understand why an already attractive person would want to do this. In a way, it serves them right.\n\n  • avatar Miguel says:\n\n    Holy crap…I remember her from her sitcom, and she was super hot! Now she looks like a caricature. Oh Nikki…enough with the collagen already.\n\n  • avatar Vera says:\n\n    She looks awful, and her lips were nice to begin with.\n\n  • avatar Helen says:\n\n    Her lips were OK. Now she looks, sick and psychologically ill.\n\n  • avatar Garrison says:\n\n    Use to be hot. Now she looks like a sick puppet.\n\n  • avatar emmi says:\n\n    What a shame… Just saw her on Rachel Ray, barely recognized her.\n\n  • avatar emily says:\n\n    she didn’t even need it!! why why why would she do that to her pretty lips\n\n  • avatar Camille UK says:\n\n    To be honest I haven’t got a clue who she is perhaps It’s because I’m from the UK or sumthin but she had full lips before and was beautiful don’t get me wrong she’s still beautiful but It’s not up to us anyway It’s how she feels inside.\n    She looks Billie Piper-esque with the bigger lips.\n    I wonder if It’s injections or a full blown implant in her lips?\n    Anyway if she doesn’t like it then I hope for her it was injectables so won’t be there for life, but if it is how she wants to look then fair play but this is the result of plumpin already plump beautiful lips.\n    Anyway your still beautiful don’t let people put you down hun if they do just no you can be the better person and rise above it as there just wishin that they had even a tiny bit of your beauty.\n\n  • avatar N.D. says:\n\n    Nikki was always girl next door beautiful. Approachably pretty, like you could shake her hand, or even let her hold your baby. That’s what I always liked about her. That she’s likeable from a female perspective as well as male.\n\n    Guys always thought she was hot. Flaming red hair and curves do that to them. Girls generally think she’s really pretty. I’m pretty sure most people who know who she is think she comes accross as very sweet.\n\n    That’s why this photo’s sad. Because she temporarily(I hope), destroyed what was so great about her looks.\n\n    There aren’t many women who both girls and guys can agree are pretty and/or hot. Nikki was rare, now she’s common. Now she’s like almost every other starlet. So sad. From a diamond to a CZ in one visit to the doctor’s office.\n\n    I really hope it wears off. Then she’ll be back to her diamond-self.\n\n  • avatar B.C. says:\n\n    I just saw her on the Ghost Whisperer and I am in shock. She did not nee to do that, but no one can say what she may have been going through or thinking. I would hope people research their doctors before getting augmentations like this.\n\n  • avatar ALEX13 says:\n\n    If you want to see her thai twin sister than go to this website\n\n  • avatar Alex says:\n\n    I was in the Vons store in Manhattan Beach years ago, you run into actors there all the time, BFD. I was making my way down an aisle, when I looked up and she was just standing there, staring at me. We look at each other. She gave me the most disgusted look, like what are you, and what on earth are you looking at? It kinda hurt my feelings. I wanted to say, Ms Cox I’ve lived here since 1969. I stole candy bars from this store when I was 7 years old, Man Bch is my home town. I just thought wow, this girl is so smoking hot, why would she bother hate-vibing a poor sad sack like me? I just looked up and she was there, it’s not like I was following her, for Pete’s sake, I see actors all the time, I’m cordial to them, I’ll say hello, most of them are perfectly nice and otherwise ordinary people. Weird.\n\n  • avatar EMS says:\n\n    When I saw her as a guest star on a tv show earlier this year, I was aghast and burst out laughing!\n    She looks like she’s wearing those funny wax lips. It’s ridiculous. She can’t actually like the results. Her cosmetologist ought to be sued.\n\n  • avatar Late Responer says:\n\n    What a shame. A really pretty girl turned plastic. Is that lip job something that will go away or is it there to stay?\n\n  • avatar Kaydee says:\n\n    Its funny that you said she is wearing her labia on her face. Actually, everyone wears labia on their faces, because the word “labia” means lips.\n\n    I see what you are saying, though. I wonder if, since she is now in her early 30s, she is afraid of getting old. That is sad, though, to spend that time in your life being afraid of getting old, when you are probably facing 50 more years of getting older. We don’t have to be in our 20s to be beautiful. It’s important to try to appreciate what you have while you have it!\n\n  • avatar LiberalsRCommies says:\n\n    What is wrong with women today?? This is grotesque. She had great lips to begin with. Women are blind.\n\nLeave a Reply to Miguel\n\nLeave a Reply to Miguel Cancel reply\n\n\nGo to the top of the page",

        "text": "Triggering On-Demand Source Data Loads from within PBCS\n\nDefining the Problem\n\nHello all and welcome to another episode of “this before was a problem”. Firstly before starting, lets state the obvious I really like PBCS and in my opinion the benefits of PBCS far outweigh that of On-Premise Hyperion and I am sure some would disagree, but hence why this is my opinion and you are also welcome to yours (maybe this will be a topic for a future blog post). This leaves me with interesting tasks which are finding areas where PBCS might have limitations that are not issues in on-premise Hyperion and I simply try to find solutions / workarounds to address these limitations.\n\nToday we look at on-demand data loads from source to PBCS. In on-premise Hyperion, if the requirement is to trigger on-demand data loads from within Hyperion they are a few options like Calc Manager command line triggers or Workspace Generic Jobs both of which can trigger batch scripts on the underlying servers to trigger the load from source systems to Hyperion. In PBCS this is a lot more difficult for a few reasons:\n\n  • Firstly PBCS is a cloud solution this means that if a request is to initiate from PBCS to an on-premise system, IT would have to allow communication initiating from the internet (PBCS) to On-Premise systems. This is usually considered a security risk and frowned upon by IT (I don’t agree with that, but its the hurdles that will be thrown your way. You will feel like IT has asked you to run the 100m hurdles and you will be required to jump through many technical hoops to get through to acceptance. I simply believe its a complex requirement that would require a robust secure technical solution to resolve, but not a showstopper).\n  • Secondly PBCS is not able to initiate request to external systems with exception to those allowed by Oracle (SSO and other Oracle Cloud Services/Sources).\n\nYou could argue well why bother, you can simply schedule source loads to run more often or have the users trigger the loads via On-Premise EPM Automate batch scripts, custom groovy consoles, Process Management systems, the source system and many other ways. However the reality is this, when a client / customer makes the investment in PBCS they are investing in a cloud solution and that’s exactly what they want. They want to login to PBCS and do everything they need in one place. Asking them to do things outside of PBCS for PBCS specific activities doesn’t carry the same glamour of  a new age cloud system (feels like its not quite there), (paused for a few minutes to think of a good example… here we go) kind of like going to see your favorite sports team play, but then sitting in the worst seat in the venue. Sure its better than not going, but you’re there and it could be better. Well in the case of the game, you have two options: wait for the game to start, assess the free seats and try to sneak to better seats or buy better tickets. Likewise with PBCS you can look for a work around or wait for improvements to the software overtime from Oracle. You are probably wondering how many times I snuck to better seats to see my favorite team play, well the sad answer is none, I have yet to see my favorite team play (Hala Madrid), so I will tell you after I do go (#bucketlist).\n\nI am sure in the future PBCS will be able to communicate with more systems and more easily, but for now we are still tasked with a mission to “find a way from within PBCS to trigger an on-demand data load to extract data from source systems and load it to PBCS”.\n\nSome Assumptions Before We Start\n\n  • To be absolutely clear in this particular requirement we have assumed the source system is not Oracle Financial Cloud, Oracle Netsuite or any other Oracle Cloud Product that PBCS can directly integrate with and pull data directly from (through a request that is initialized from PBCS).\n  • We assume we are using two main systems an on-premise source system (ERP or other system) and PBCS.\n  • We assume that the source system extract is defined at source or calling script layer (for example PL & BS data for current month), we are not passing back specific period requests or specific data requests. Whatever files are extracted from source we will load. Further enhancements to the script / process to include functionality to allow specific data requests and periods parameters are possible, but have not been included in this example.\n  • We assume clearing of the data is actioned by the administrator in PBCS prior submitting the source data load request in this example. Technically this can be done within the process, but for this example I have not included.\n  • We have assumed the administrator triggering this script will be notified via the email distribution group as part of the execution of the process. Again this is another area that could be enhanced to send only to the requester of the load based on a parameter or a different approach, but for this example I have adopted an email distribution approach for administrators.\n  • The load file names drive the load process, for example, BS_Actual_Jan-18.txt will be used to run the data load rule BS and load to period Jan-18.\n  • We have used EPM Automate to create this process (the process can also be built using direct REST API queries from Groovy or another tool/software).\n\n\nBefore starting if you are expecting a very elegant and clean solution you won’t get one (but I like to think the solution is as elegant as possible given the limitations). If there was such a thing there would be no point to write this post. This is because we are working with limitations of the software, so this is and must be viewed as work around (a clever work around) to an issue.\n\nSo what is the clever solution? Thought you would never ask….\n\nWe simply do the following:\n\n  • Create a substitution variable in PBCS called “Source_Load”, The variable will be set by default to “False”, but will serve as a status request. If the administrator wants the data loaded from source he/she simply updates this variable to “True”.\n  • We will have EPM Automate Probe PBCS for the status of this variable. If the Source_Load variable value is set to “True”, the source data will be extracted and loaded to PBCS. On completion an email with the status of the execution will be sent to the administrator(s) (via distribution email).\n\nSimple, of course it is, we like it this way!!!!\n\nSo here goes the demo.\n\nFirst The Code\n\n::  Author Name:\t\tAhmed Hafez (Hyperion Jedi)\n::  Creation Date:\t\t02/02/2018\n::  File/CMD Name:\t\tOn-Demand_PBCS_Source_Load.cmd\n::  Description:\t\tChecks for the value of substitution variable in PBCS and if true loads data from source \n\n@echo off\n\nset user=<enter user here>\nset pass=<enter password here>\nset url=\"https://<PBCS URL>\"\nset domain=<enter domain here>\nset coredir=<directory>\\On-Demand_PBCS_Source_Load\\core\nset loaddatadir=<directory>\\On-Demand_PBCS_Source_Load\\files\nset logfile=\"<directory>\\On-Demand_PBCS_Source_Load.log\"\nset workingdir=\"<EPM Automate Bin Directory>\"\nset smtpserver='<enter smtp server here>'\nset emaildistgroup='<enter email distribution email>'\nset starttime=\"08:00:00,00\"\nset endtime=\"20:00:00,00\"\nset timeouttime=60\n\n\nset \"now=%time: =0%\"\nif \"%now%\" lss %starttime%( goto :ENDLOOP )\nif \"%now%\" geq %endtime% ( goto :ENDLOOP )\n\ncall %workingdir%\\epmautomate login %user% %pass% %url% %domain% > %logfile%\n\nsetlocal enabledelayedexpansion\nFOR /F \"tokens=2 delims== skip=1\" %%g IN ('\"call epmautomate getsubstvar ALL name=Source_Load\"') do (\nSET Request=%%g\nIF !Request!==False goto :LOGOUT\necho Request has been made to load data from source >> %logfile%\n\ncall %coredir%\\Run_Source_System_Extract.bat\n\nsetlocal enabledelayedexpansion\nFor /R %loaddatadir% %%A IN (*.txt) do (\nSet loadfile=%%~nxA\nSet load=!loadfile:~0,-18!\nSet period=\"!loadfile:~-10,-4!\"\necho Delete existing file prior upload inbox/!load!/!loadfile! >> %logfile%\ncall %workingdir%\\epmautomate deletefile inbox/!load!/!loadfile! >> %logfile%\necho Uploadfile to PBCS \"%%A\" and place in inbox/!load! >> %logfile%\ncall %workingdir%\\epmautomate uploadfile \"%%A\" inbox/!load! >> %logfile%\necho Load data using load rule !load! for period !period! >> %logfile%\ncall %workingdir%\\epmautomate rundatarule !load! !period! !period!

I think the key is to start simple and go from there. I like current and prior period default extract approach, this usually covers most requirements.\n\n\nThis is a simple solution to the issue of not being able to trigger on-demand data loads from within PBCS. I am sure the solution can be further improved and decked out with many options and features and probably could be delivered in many different ways. This is an approach that I found was fairly simple, easy to implement and delivered the required solution.\n\nMessage To My Friends\n\nTo my followers / friends I really wish you find this helpful and entertaining. To anyone reading one of my posts for the first time I welcome you and hope you find success and fun times in your PBCS / Hyperion journeys ahead.\n\nMay you always be with the force and may the force always be with you!\n\nLeave a Reply\n\n\nYou are commenting using your account.

        "text": "Fallout 5: Latest news, leaks, release date speculation, and everything we know So Far\n\nshare to other networks share to twitter share to facebook\nfallout 5\nSeptember 5, 2022 - The last Fallout 5 news is below:\n\nFallout 5 isn't likely to be a game you're playing anytime soon. Fallout 76 wasn't the best last entry to leave things on. Sure the game has improved considerably since launch, but it's fair to say it had a rocky first few years and underdelivered compared with previous outings.\n\nFallout 4 wasn't considered the pinnacle of the series either, although, it's fair to say that the game had a tough act to follow after the huge success of Fallout 3 and Fallout New Vegas.\n\nWhichever way you look at it, there's work to be done making the next one as good as possible. So, what do we know about Fallout 5? Here's everything we've heard so far. For more on Bethesda games, check out the latest on Starfield and The Elder Scrolls 6.\n\nLatest news\n\n16 June, 2022\n\nFollowing the Bethesda/Xbox E3-but-not-E3 showcase, Todd Howard provided a little insight into when we can expect the next Fallout game.\n\nIn an interview with IGN, he said:\n\n\"Yes, Elder Scrolls 6 is in pre-production... and, you know, we’re going to be doing Fallout 5 after that, so our slate’s pretty full going forward for a while. We have some other projects that we look at from time to time as well.\"\n\n10 November, 2021 -\n\nIn an interview with IGN, Bethesda chief, Todd Howard, implies that Fallout 5 is being proposed with brief ideas in contention. The team has a \"one-page turner\" for the project, but nothing is being committed to just yet, with the title years away from a potential release.\n\nYou know, we have a one-pager on Fallout 5, what we want to do. Again, if I could wave my hand and have [Fallout 5] out – you know, I'd like to find a way to accelerate what we do, but I can't really say today or commit to anything, [like] what's going to happen [or] when.\n\n12 March 2021 -\n\nSpeaking following the acquisition of Bethesda Game Studios, Xbox Boss Phil Spencer answered the question on everyone's mind - will Bethesda games be exclusive?\n\n\"If you’re an Xbox customer, the thing I want you to know is this is about delivering great exclusive games for you that ship on platforms where Game Pass exists, and that’s our goal.\"\n\n17th November 2020 -\n\n“What we’ll do in the long run is we don’t have intentions of just pulling all of Bethesda content out of Sony or Nintendo or otherwise,” Tim Stuart, Xbox's Chief Financial Officer said.\n\n“But what we want is we want that content, in the long run, to be either first or better or best or pick your differentiated experience, on our platforms. We will want Bethesda content to show up the best as — on our platforms.\" Could this be the case for Fallout 5?\n\nfallout 5\nclick to enlarge\n+ 4\n\nFallout 5 release date speculation\n\nSpeculation suggests that the game will launch sometime in Fall 2022. There's no telling when the actual release date will be, but based on the time between the releases of Fallout 3 and Fallout 4, it would have been logical to expect this title sometime in 2022. However, we're in 2022 now and we've not heard a peep.\n\nIt's widely expected that Elder Scrolls 6 will launch before Fallout 5. With the on-going COVID-19 pandemic, this could be pushed back further to accommodate for those studios working at home.\n\n\nOur best guess? We don't expect to see Fallout 5 until at least 2025 at the very earliest.\n\n\nWe'd expect Fallout 5 to launch on Xbox Series X and PC. With Microsoft acquiring Bethesda, it's left doubt about whether the next game will launch elsewhere. Phil Spencer has said Bethesda will run \"semi-independently\". Not all games will be exclusive and will be decided on a case-by-case basis.\n\nDoes this mean it'll come to PlayStation 5? It's hard to say right now, after all, Fallout 76 is still supported on PlayStation consoles. But realistically we imagine Xbox will look to release the game exclusively on Xbox platforms.\n\nfallout 5\nclick to enlarge\n+ 4\n\nPossible location and setting\n\n\nThe setting and location for Fallout 5 are obviously unknown, but past titles have all featured in a US state; so we can expect this to be the same again.\n\nFallout 3 was in Washington, before moving north to Boston in Fallout 4. Fallout 76 saw players move back south to West Virginia. All the newer games seemed to be set on the east coast, only Fallout New Vegas and the original 2 Fallouts were set in the west.\n\nSo where are we going next? The smart money is on remaining in the east of the US. But there are a few locations that are more likely than others.\n\nNew Orleans\n\nA trademark application was made in 2016 for the property 'Fallout New Orleans'. We have visited the south before including Fallout 3’s DLC 'Point Lookout' and 'Far Harbor' in Fallout 4, so it's not unlikely.\n\n\nChicago featured in Fallout Tactics, a turn-based real-time tactical role-playing game. In New Vegas, ED-E hints at Enclave outposts in Chicago, meaning we may have unfinished business out there.\n\n\n\nPerhaps the new Fallout will go back in time? Back to 2077? It's a place and time we've visited before, namely Operation Anchorage (the first DLC in Fallout 3).\n\nSomewhere else?\n\nCould we be going somewhere else entirely? Is it finally time to go across seas? Perhaps we will head to China or Russia to see the story from a different perspective. Europe will no doubt be a popular location to visit.\n\nfallout 5\nclick to enlarge\n+ 4\n\nMultiplayer and online co-op\n\nFallout 76 aside, Fallout games have always been focused around single-player gameplay. Todd Howard, series director, has claimed that every game they've created has been designed with a multiplayer mode \"just to see what we could do\". That being said, we would expect Fallout 5 to heavily focus on the single-player story and activities. Todd Howard has also assured players that they \"want to keep [games] as single player\".\n\nIt could be that Bethesda try to incorporate some social features in the game, but then again, they likely want to keep it largely separate enough to not feel like a true sequel to the most multiplayer-led Fallout 76 experience.\n\nfallout 5\nclick to enlarge\n+ 4\n\nA new engine\n\n\nGiven how glitchy Fallout games are and how many were found in Fallout 76, it could be that we're looking at a brand new engine for the game. Fallout 76 was a heavily modified version of the Creation Engine. A Zenimax job listing, which has now been removed, indicates that the company were looking for an engine programmer to “develop cutting edge technologies.” This makes sense with the PS5 and Xbox Series X being released and boasting much more power under their hoods than the PS4 and Xbox One.\n\nElder Scrolls 6 is likely coming before the next Fallout game, and we suspect the engine for ES6 is likely to be what Bethesda use moving forward with Fallout 5.\n\nGameplay details\n\nWhile there are no specific details on the gameplay side of things, there are plenty of takeaways from Fallout 4. The 2015 title featured reduced roleplaying mechanics and was considered to have disappointing graphics; something that didn't improve in Fallout 76.\n\nFallout 4 brought in voice acting for our protagonist, but ultimately at the expense of varied dialogue choices. One thing Fallout 4 was praised for was the introduction of Fallout Settlements. Being able to expand on this and improved options is almost a certainty. Overall, we'd expect similar gameplay with a few new additions and improvements to existing mechanics. Again, look to what Bethesda release with Starfield and Elder Scrolls 6, which we imagine will have a big say on the eventual direction of Fallout 5.",

Unfortunately little raw data on failures in large IT installations is publicly available, due to the confidential nature of this data. This paper analyzes soon-to-be public failure data covering systems at a large high-performance-computing site. The data has been collected over the past 9 years at Los Alamos National Laboratory and includes 23000 failures recorded on more than 20 different systems, mostly large clusters of SMP and NUMA nodes. We study the statistics of the data, including the root cause of failures, the mean time between failures, and the mean time to repair. We find for example that average failure rates differ wildly across systems, ranging from 20-1000 failures per year, and that time between failures is modeled well by a Weibull distribution with decreasing hazard rate. From one system to another, mean repair time varies from less than an hour to more than a day, and repair times are well modeled by a lognormal distribution.\n\n\nPublisher Statement\n\nAll Rights Reserved",

Eating this burger right now. I really like it. Has a nice tangy kick to it. I was a little confused as to why the garlic chips are pink colored though.\n\n  2. I had the crispy chicken version. I am in love! It was stacked with garlic chips. I adore garlic. I cherish and respect it. I carry around a bottle of roasted garlic powder. Next time I will want to get even more garlic chips. I ordered mine without the nasty lettuce and tomato.\n\n  3. I tried this with the grilled chicken. I received mine with a couple of chunks of lettuce on it instead of shredded lettuce and picked the tomato off since I can’t have it. Either the store I got this from was out of the garlic aioli, they just don’t know what’s supposed to be on it and used regular mayo, or the garlic aioli tastes just like regular mayo. Plus the bun was way over toasted and pretty black and they melted the cheese onto the bun which made it a greasy white square on the round black bun, yuck. Add in the weird salty pink things masquerading as garlic chips and the over all experience was pretty disappointing when it sounded like something halfway decent.\n\n    Frankly I don’t think fixing the prep issues would help this sandwich at all. Can they stop with the weird concoctions and just bring back things like the mushroom-swiss burger and the chicken ranch club? Those were good.\n\nLeave a Reply\n\n",

        "text": "UK samples set for a taste of space\n\n\nSamples of micro organisms, antibodies, fluorescent dyes and rock from Devon are amongst a European payload which will be sent into near Earth orbit this week onboard an unmanned Russian spacecraft - exposing them to the extreme conditions found in space.\n\nThe Foton - M3 capsule will be launched by a Soyuz rocket from Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on Friday 14th September at 12 noon BST (1700 local time). After 9 minutes of propelled flight the Foton will reach a low earth orbit where it will remain for 11.8 days before the re-entry capsule will return to Earth.\n\nThe Foton-M3 will be carrying a European payload of 400 kg covering experiments in a wide range of disciplines including fluid physics, biology, crystal growth, meteoritics, radiation dosimetry and exobiology.\n\nThe European Space Agency's (ESA) Biopan facility which is attached to the outside of the Foton will be used to expose experiment samples directly to the space environment in order to study the impact of space's extreme temperatures, ultraviolet, cosmic and other solar radiation, and near-perfect vacuum.\n\nAmongst the samples that make up the Biopan payload are the following which are in part funded by the Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC):-\n\n  • Antibodies and fluorescent dyes to be used in the Life Marker Chip (LMC) instrument that is being developed under UK lead for ESA's ExoMars mission\n  • Micro organisms for ESA's STONE artificial meteorite experiment\n  • Rock samples containing micro organisms from cliffs at Beer, East Devon\n\nThe LMC will look for specific molecules associated with life by detecting biomarkers. Such techniques have been developed in the medical and biotechnology sectors but have not been used in space before. LMC lead scientist Dr Mark Sims from University of Leicester, comments, \"Space is inherently a risky business but there are only so many tests that you can do on the ground. Biopan provides us with a platform to expose biological samples to a space environment and gives us the opportunity to expose our biosensor components to a space radiation environment in order to confirm their survivability.\"\n\nDr David Cullen, LMC scientist and lead scientist on the LMC on Biopan experiment, from Cranfield University adds, \"We will be testing the effect of various extreme environments encountered during space flight of antibodies and fluorescent dyes such as the effects of launch and re-entry, ground handling and the space radiation environment - all critical issues for a future Mars mission.\"\n\nAlso onboard Biopan, all be it on the outside of the capsule, are samples of micro organisms that make up the ESA STONE artificial meteorite experiment. The organisms are dried onto the underside of several artificial meteorites made from sedimentary and igneous rocks which are attached to the outside of the heat shield - exposing them fully to the space environment.\n\nThis follows up an experiment flown on the previous Foton flight which demonstrated how the atmospheric transit of organisms acts as a strong biogeographical dispersal filter to the interplanetary transfer of photosynthesis. This time the experiment will focus on whether by being on the underside of different materials effects the survival of organisms during atmospheric entry.\n\nProfessor of Microbiology and STONE scientist Charles Cockell from The Open University explains further, \"This work advances our knowledge of how island biogeography might work on an interplanetary scale. We know that life can make it from continent to continent, but what about from planet to planet? Of course, at the moment we don't know of life on another planet, but this experiment is an intriguing test of an interplanetary version of an old ecological question and can at least tell us whether the Earth has always remained a biological island in space.\"\n\nProfessor Cockell adds, \"We will also be sending up samples of rock from Beer in Devon as part of experiment called LITHOPANSPERMIA. The samples contain diverse photosynthetic organisms. This is to test the ability of organisms to survive in interplanetary conditions. Photosynthesis is the basis of a productive biosphere, so understanding its ability to be transferred between planets is of great interest. \"\n\nThe re-entry capsule is scheduled to land in a remote area on the Russian/Kazahkstan border on 26th September where it will be recovered by a specialist team. The samples from the ESA experiments will first be transported to its ESTEC facility in the Netherlands and then to various other institutions for further analysis.\n\nFor related ESA materials and to follow the progress of the mission see http://www.esa.int/esaCP/SEMN5ZMPQ5F_FeatureWeek_0.html\n\nPress Contacts\n\nGill Ormrod - Science and Technology Facilities Council Press Office\nTel: 01793 442012.

The agreement covered two Foton flights (Foton-M2 and Foton-M3), which have a combined total of 660kg of ESA supplied scientific payloads onboard.\n\nBiopan has a motor driven, hinged lid and is equipped with devices and sensors that measure the various aspects of the environment to which the experiments are subjected. Once Foton is in orbit, a telecommand is sent from the ground and the lid opens to expose the samples to the environment. At the end of the mission, another command is sent and the lid closes. Since Biopan is on the outside of the Foton, it also has its own ablative heat shield to protect the facility and samples during the space craft's re-entry and landing.\n\nScience and Technology Facilities Council\n\n\n\n* The Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, Oxfordshire\n\n* The Daresbury Laboratory, Cheshire\n\n* The UK Astronomy Technology Centre, Edinburgh\n\n\nThe Council distributes public money from the Government to support scientific research. Between 2007 and 2008 we will invest approximately over 700 million pounds.\n\n\nPlease follow SpaceRef on Twitter and Like us on Facebook.",

        "text": "Sunday, April 18 2021 This week – April 11-17, 2021 – in the Occupied Territories\n\nWith the start of Ramadan, Jerusalem police is focusing on disturbing the Palestinians’ prayers and holiday celebrations around Damascus Gate in Jerusalem, causing friction and arrests; the violent expropriation operation by settler-colonists in the South Hebron Hills is expanding, and more and more Palestinian communities in the region remain without grazing grounds for their flocks and without grain crops – Israeli activists accompany shepherds all days of the week, and sleep overnight in threatened communities; this week’s massive protest demonstration in the Jerusalem neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrah went unhampered;\n\nEast Jerusalem\nSince Ramadan month began, the Jerusalem police, and policemen of the ‘Shalem’ station in particular, have been busy harassing Palestinian inhabitants of the area and disrupting their holiday. On Wednesday, the police turned off the loudspeakers at the Al Aqsa Mosque in order to prevent disturbances of the opening ceremonies of the Israeli Memorial Day at the Western (Wailing) Wall. Furthermore, the police decided to place barriers on the steps leading to the Damascus Gate where hundreds of Palestinians traditionally spend the Ramadan nights. Consequently, daily friction is created and many cases of police brutality and arrests are documented.\nOn Friday the weekly protest demonstration at Sheikh Jarrah took place, against the authorities’ intention to evict Palestinians from their homes there and turn the houses over to Jewish settler-colonists. Unlike last week’s demonstration, this week events remained unhampered as the police did not intervene and did not exert violence.\nThe inhabitants of the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood protest the theft of their homes, the settler-colonist takeover of the neighborhood and the general Judaization of the Eastern part of Jerusalem, and call upon anyone supporting their struggle to join them.\nThe weekly protest in Sheikh Jarrah takes place every Friday. The residents of Sheikh Jarrah are protesting their violent evictions from their homes, the taking over of the neighborhood by the settlers, and the Judaization of East Jerusalem. They call upon each and every person who supports their struggle to join them.\n\nSouth Hebron Hills\nMore and more grazing grounds are turning into out-of-bounds areas for Palestinians, and entire shepherd communities remain unable to graze their flocks. At the same time, settler-colonists invade privately-owned and tended Palestinian fields, destroying the grain crops. On Monday this week, settler-colonists from the new outpost near ‘Havat Maon’ chased away Palestinian shepherds using fire arms and threats, and tried to blame the shepherds for this assault. On Friday and Saturday, they were documented by activists as they invaded tended fields with their fields and prevented the shepherds from reaching their privately-owned land. The activists summoned the police, but it refrained from doing anything against the violent settler-colonists. Near Zanouta as well, on Saturday settler-colonists chased away Palestinian shepherds, directed their dogs against the flock and attacked the shepherds and activists who accompanied them. The same day, settler-colonists also chased away Palestinian flocks in Umm Zaitouna, chased the shepherds all the way to their homes and summoned army and police. The DCO official who arrived confirmed that the Palestinian shepherds were in areas where they are allowed, but did not take any measures against the settler-colonists who had chased them away.\nOn Thursday and Friday, settler-colonists invaded privately owned and tended Palestinian grain fields at Atariya and destroyed the crop. Activists present documented this incursion and summoned the police, which arrived after the invaders had left. On Thursday settler-colonists began to steal with tractors soil from Palestinians’ farmlands in the area opposite settler-colony ‘Maon’. Inhabitants and activists were summoned and called the police, but the DCO official who arrived enabled the theft to continue.\nFollowing these invasions of fields and chasing away of Palestinians’ flocks, this week activists accompanied shepherds in Atariya on Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday, at Bani Naim on Monday and Wednesday, around the new outpost near ‘Havat Maon’ on Monday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday, and in Zanouta on Saturday. On Tuesday and Thursday activists spent the night at Simra for fear of harassment by the settler-colonists of ‘Mitzpe Yair’. Activists also helped clear rubble at Rakeez on Monday, at Khalat A-Ghaba on Wednesday, and farm work opposite ‘Maon’ on Friday.\nOn Monday the occupation forces destroyed seasonal tents north of Susya and near Bani Naim, and dismantled a door that was installed at the entrance to a cave in Thawamin. The same day, the forces also demolished 3 structures in the area of Al Khader and Bethlehem.\n\nPalestinian Jordan Valley and the West Bank Hill Range\nAround the Tayibe Junction and Deir Jarayer of the West Bank Hill Range as well, the settler-colonists continue to lead their flocks into Palestinians’ private tended fields. On Sunday, activists arrived there but there were no flocks to be seen. On Monday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday the activists were busy chasing away settler-colonists’ flocks from the fields.\nAt Auja in the southern Palestinian Jordan Valley, activists accompanied shepherds on Monday. A military force tried to prevent this grazing but the activists insisted the shepherds have a right to be there, and the army left.\nIn the northern Palestinian Jordan Valley activists accompanied shepherds from Makhoul on Sunday and grazing proceeded unhampered.",
