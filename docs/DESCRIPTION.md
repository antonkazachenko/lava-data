# Lava Data Survey: Project Description

> _Illuminating how people read, feel, and act on data when it shifts from the familiar static page to a living, responsive canvas._

## Vision
The Lava Data Survey examines how people experience information when presented in traditional static visualizations compared with interactive, bubble-based interfaces. The project aims to ground design decisions in evidence rather than intuition by observing real users as they navigate both modalities.

## Research Focus
- **Population**: Participants across varied backgrounds and data literacy levels.
- **Mediums Under Test**: Conventional charts, word-frequency summaries, and modern bubble visualizations rendered on the web.
- **Outcomes**: Comprehension, perceived usefulness, memorability, engagement, and exploratory behavior.

## Comparative Lens
| Dimension | Traditional Visualization | Modern Bubble Visualization |
|-----------|---------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Presentation | Static charts and lists (bar, pie, word frequencies) | Responsive, animated clusters of data-rich bubbles |
| Interaction | Limited to reading values | Direct manipulation, hover/click exploration, guided animations |
| Expected Advantages | Familiarity, quick scanning, easy printing | Higher engagement, richer storytelling, layered context |
| Open Questions | Do static formats still win on clarity? | Do bubbles deepen understanding without overwhelming users? |

## Motivation
Traditional visualizations enjoy decades of validation, while interactive techniques remain under-documented. Lava Data addresses this gap by:
1. Capturing quantitative feedback on clarity, delight, and trust.
2. Measuring comprehension improvements when motion and interaction are introduced.
3. Tracking behavioral analytics (time on task, revisit patterns) to gauge engagement.
4. Surfacing demographic nuances in preference and performance.

## Method in Brief
- **Experience Design**: Built with TypeScript and React to support real-time interactions in the [Lava Data web app](https://lava-data-lamp.netlify.app/).
- **Research Instruments**: Structured surveys, embedded tasks, optional interviews, and analytics tracing micro-interactions.
- **Experimental Flow**: Participants alternate between static and bubble-based views, completing interpretation challenges paired with self-reported impressions.
- **Analysis Plan**: Blend statistical comparisons (accuracy, completion time) with qualitative sentiment to triangulate findings.

## Anticipated Contributions
- A clearer understanding of when traditional approaches suffice and where dynamic interfaces add measurable value.
- Evidence-backed guidance for designers deciding between static charts and richer, animated canvases.
- A reusable research framework for testing emergent visualization paradigms against entrenched standards.

## Next Steps
- Finalize participant recruitment pipeline and ensure demographic diversity.
- Tighten instrumentation to capture nuanced interaction signals without compromising performance.
- Iterate on both visualization variants based on early pilot feedback before running the full study.

The Lava Data Survey aspires to bridge scholarly insight and practical design, ensuring that the next wave of visual storytelling is both beautiful and empirically grounded.
